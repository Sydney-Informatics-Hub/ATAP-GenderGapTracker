While some cheered the platforms' response, experts noted that these actions follow years of hemming and hawing regarding Trump and his supporters spreading dangerous misinformation and encouraging violence that contributed to Wednesday's events.

Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor and an expert on social media, said what happened in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday is a direct result of Trump's use of social media to spread propaganda and disinformation, and that the platforms should bear some responsibility for their previous inaction.

""This is what happens,"" Grygiel said. ""We didn't just see a breach at the Capitol. Social media platforms have been breached by the president repeatedly. This is disinformation. This was a coup attempt in the United States.""

Grygiel said the platform's decision to remove the video — and Twitter's suspension — are too little, too late.

""They're creeping along towards firmer action,"" Grygiel said, calling Trump ""Exhibit A"" for the need for greater regulation of social media. ""Social media is complicit in this because he has repeatedly used social media to incite violence. It's a culmination of years of propaganda and abuse of media by the president of the United States.""

Trump posted the video more than two hours after protesters entered the Capitol, interrupting lawmakers meeting in a joint session to confirm the electoral college results and president-elect Joe Biden's victory.

Too little, too late?
Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice-president of integrity, said on Twitter Wednesday that the video was removed because it ""contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.""

""This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video,"" Rosen said.


Twitter initially left the video up but blocked people from being able to retweet it or comment on it. Only later in the day did the platform delete it entirely.

Trump opened his video saying, ""I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now.""

After repeating false claims about voter fraud affecting the election, Trump went on to say: ""We can't play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You're very special."""

Republican lawmakers and previous administration officials had begged Trump to give a statement to his supporters to quell the violence. He posted his video as authorities struggled to take control of a chaotic situation at the Capitol that led to the evacuation of lawmakers and the death of at least one person.

Trump has harnessed social media — especially Twitter — as a potent tool for spreading misinformation about the election. Wednesday's riot only increased calls to ban Trump from the platform.

""The President has promoted sedition and incited violence,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, in a statement. ""More than anything, what is happening right now at the Capitol is a direct result of the fear and disinformation that has been spewed consistently from the Oval Office.""

In a statement Thursday morning, Trump said there would be an ""orderly transition on January 20th"" and acknowledged defeat in the election for the first time. His aides posted the statement on Twitter because his account remained suspended."

Pacific expert Anna Powles from Massey University told the ABC ""very little"" was currently known about the meeting but it seemed to be part of China's broader attempts to sideline the PIF.

""It appears to be an attempt to deliberately disrupt existing regional mechanisms which China is not a part of,"" she said."

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese drew a parallel between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and cross-strait tensions between China and Taiwan, saying Vladimir Putin's failed bid to take Ukraine showed ""attempts to impose change by force on a sovereign country meets resistance"". 

The China Daily newspaper took aim at Mr Albanese's comment, saying his answer ""revealed his lack of diplomatic nous and poor grasp of political realities"". 

""It is hard to believe that the new Australian leader can be so ill-informed as to not know China's stance on the Ukraine crisis, which it has clarified on multiple occasions, or that he can be so ignorant as not to understand the status of Taiwan,"" the editorial read.

The piece also attacked the Labor government for ""eagerly jumping on the US bandwagon, drumming up support for its containment policy against China"". 

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian also criticised Mr Albanese for making ""irresponsible remarks"" after he warned Beijing to learn the lessons of Russia's ""strategic failure"" in Ukraine.

""We have repeatedly stated China's position on the Ukraine crisis. We have also stressed many times that Taiwan is not Ukraine and there is no comparison between the two,"" Mr Zhao said.

Mr Albanese attended this week's NATO summit in Madrid, where he backed the organisation's move to declare that China's ""ambitions and coercive policies"" constituted a challenge to NATO's ""interests security and values"". 

The China Daily said there were ""high hopes"" of a reset when Labor took power but those hopes were ""diminishing"" by the day

However, it said there were ""a few positives keeping the embers alive"", including the meeting between Defence Minister Richard Marles and his Chinese counterpart, General Wei Fenghe. 

""Since Albanese took office, Beijing has displayed goodwill in the hope that Canberra will be willing to work with it to improve bilateral ties,"" The China Daily said.

While Chinese state media editorials are not definitive statements of government policy, they are still ticked off by the party apparatus.

""It is a reflection on the mood in Beijing, in the government, about trying to bring the new Australian government into line with what Beijing wants,"" John Garrick, a senior lecturer and research fellow at Charles Darwin University said.

""It's actually concerning language because it is an intensification.

""It follows two critical incidents in late May this year where, in separate locations, Chinese fighters intercepted maritime patrol aircraft of both Australia and Canada in the western Pacific.""

The government has said Chinese fighter jets moved to dangerously intercept an Australian maritime surveillance plane not long after Labor won the federal election — an issue not mentioned in the China Daily editorial.

Dr Garrick said China had been sensitive about US and allied maritime surveillance operations close to its shores, and these incidents could reflect the start of a new campaign to intensify military pressure on America's leadership in Asia by ""attempting to erode its regional strategic posture and alliances"".

""In this context, the China Daily language about the new Australian Prime Minister would be in line with an intensification of Beijing's strategy for dealing with US allies,"" Dr Garrick said."
