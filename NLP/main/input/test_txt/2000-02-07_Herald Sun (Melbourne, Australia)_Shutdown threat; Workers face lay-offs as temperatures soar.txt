industry  woes
VICTORIA will be hit by a workforce exodus today as power cuts force businesses to close and office staff to walk off the job.
 Businesses unable to run heat-sensitive machinery will start suspending workers today, while office staff distressed by the air-conditioning ban will be told to go home.
 Premier Steve Bracks yesterday renewed his threat to invoke crisis laws to order a return to work by both the union members and Yallourn Energy.
 "What I urge the workers to do is act in the interests of Victoria. What I am concerned about is getting power back," he said.
The state's peak employer group said yesterday that thousands of workers would be sent home as businesses were savaged by power cuts.
 The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce said businesses unable to run machinery because of the ban on air-conditioning would be sending staff home without pay.
 "Thousands of workers will be affected," VECCI workplace relations general manager David Gregory said.
 "You can stand down in situations where the circumstances are not in your control and you're not able to employ workers."
 He said industries likely to lay off staff included manufacturers, printers, and communications and computer businesses.
 With the temperature forecast to reach 29deg. today, the ban on office air-conditioning will also result in workers leaving early for health concerns.
 Mr Gregory said employers' fears of breaching occupational health and safety rules would prompt managers to send employees home.
 "Employers have a duty of care to provide and ensure a healthy workplace. If they can't provide that, you can't have people there," he said.
 "If conditions become so intolerable, you can't keep people working."
 Victorian businesses contacted by the Herald Sun yesterday were preparing for the second week of power cuts.
 Many have installed fans to provide cooler workplaces from 1pm when the air-conditioning ban starts.
 A spokesman for Telstra said yesterday that managers had been given discretion to send home any workers suffering because of the bans.
 He said Telstra had switched its exchanges to battery and diesel generators to cut use of the electricity network.
 A spokesman for Holden, one of the state's largest manufacturers, said provisions were in place for workers to be sent home, with pay, if the temperature in the plants rose above 38deg.
 The power cuts are estimated to be costing business up to $25 million a day. Mr Gregory said the VECCI was meeting today to consider compensation options for business, including a State Government fund similar to the fund set up after the 1998 gas crisis.
 "It's a State Government responsibility. The industry is regulated by the State Government with state legislation," Mr Gregory said.
 Hundreds of businesses have already been hurt by the cuts, with the VECCI receiving reports of functions being cancelled at hotels, high-tech equipment malfunctioning in offices, food factories ceasing production and printing presses being unable to operate.
