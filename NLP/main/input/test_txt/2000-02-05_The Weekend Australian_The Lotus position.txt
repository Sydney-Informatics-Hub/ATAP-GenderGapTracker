In an increasingly desperate society, homeless Mongolians are drawn to a halfway house run by an Australian nun, writes Lynne O'Donnell
DELGERMAA is 35, but looks closer to 50. She is bone thin and has no front teeth. The tiny baby she is wrapping up tight as a papoose in rags and the 14-month-old toddler hanging on her knee are the only two of her six children she knows for sure are still alive.
 Each has a different father. She doesn't know where they are either.
For most of her life, Delgermaa has been living on the streets of Ulaanbaatar. During the seemingly interminable winters, when the temperature in the Mongolian capital can dip to -40C and fierce Siberian winds slice across from the surrounding snow-covered hills, she must scramble for a place underground in the sewers, or next to the city's hot water pipes.
 Food is scarce at the best of times in a country where monthly incomes wouldn't buy a decent meal at a Brunswick Street brasserie.
 For Delgermaa and her children, life is a violent and desperate struggle, although this winter promises to be better than most. She and her two youngest are staying at Lotus House, a home for women and girls run by an Australian devotee of the radical Ananda Marga sect.
 Lotus House has been a fixture on the landscape of Mongolia's misery since 1995, when Didi Ananda Kalika, known in a former life as Gabrielle Dowling of Mulwala, turned her own tiny home into a halfway house for street children. Today, it sits behind a huge pink lotus painted on a blue wooden gate on a rutted dirt road in Yarmag, a ger village on the outskirts of the Mongolian capital.
 The road is punctuated by a higgledy-piggledy line of leaning telegraph poles that provide electricity to the homes behind the fences. Most are traditional felt tents, called gers, with no running water, heated by a furnace in the middle of the one large room.
 Beyond, one of Ulaanbaatar's three coal-fired power stations pumps out a steady spume of smoke that covers Yarmag, and all of Ulaanbaatar, in a pall that turns the sunset an Armageddon orange.
 Running through the vast white tundra separating Yarmag from the power station is a river, frozen solid at this time of year apart from a rare hole, a 200m walk across the dry, hard-packed snow, where the locals can fill their milk pails rather than queue up at the water station that opens only irregularly.
 Wolves can be seen foraging on the edges of the suburb. Nomads, mounted on Mongolian ponies, sometimes drive their cows and sheep through as they search the frozen ground for fodder.
 Late last year, Australian ambassador Ric Smith, his wife Jan and most of the eclectic expatriate community of Ulaanbaatar gathered in the yard of Lotus House to celebrate its work.
 Children dressed in brand new traditional tunics, called dels, made of bright blue and red silk especially for the occasion, ran around in the freezing cold as Smith cut a red ribbon to declare Lotus House officially open.
 Standing in the blinding sunshine, his hand grasped tight by a tiny girl in red shoes and ponytails, Smith paid tribute to Didi's efforts to provide a shelter, not only from the elements but from the violence of extreme poverty, for some of the many homeless and desperate women and girls in Ulaanbaatar.
 Delgermaa and her babies are now members of Didi's family of 42, most of them aged between two and 18. In the new Lotus House wing, built with a grant from the Australian Government and donations from Didi's innumerable friends and supporters, there is heating, running water, clean beds for all.
 Down the road, behind another fence, is a school room built from straw bales and coated with plaster. Didi says the straw is good insulation during winter.
 Twenty children, some from poor neighbourhood families, are enrolled in the Lotus House kindergarten. Despite her fame and the compassion and admiration she inspires in others, it was never Didi's intention to become a local hero to the needy of Ulaanbaatar. A shy woman in her mid-30s, Didi dresses in the orange and red of the Ananda Marga which, in the Australian consciousness at least, is more commonly associated with the Hilton Hotel bombing at the 1978 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sydney than with good works.
 Ananda Marga, which means Path of Bliss, was established in India in 1955 by a former railway clerk called P.R. Sarkar. Its popularity quickly grew and today there are thousands of followers worldwide who are involved mostly in social work programs such as disaster relief and running free schools and meditation centres. There are 11 Ananda Marga retreats in Australia.
 Controversy has dogged the sect, not least because of the Sydney bombing, for which three members were wrongly convicted and served seven years in prison, and for which another, who confessed, was later jailed.
 The bomb was aimed at India's then prime minister Moraji Desai but it killed two garbage men and a policeman instead. Australians were horrified by the nation's first taste of terrorism.
 The Ananda Marga had long been linked with lawlessness, and some in the Indian government still regularly accuse it of promoting terrorism. The group's founder, who is now known as Shri Anandamurtiji, was jailed for seven years in 1971 for murder. During India's Emergency, from 1975 to 1977, prime minister Indira Gandhi banned the sect.
 Didi joined in 1981 and trained as a nun in Sweden and India before being dispatched to Tokyo and, in 1993, to Ulaanbaatar, to teach yoga and meditation.
 The 1989 collapse of the Soviet Union, of which Mongolia was a part, had left the way open for younger Mongolians especially to explore their curiosity about alternative practices and beliefs. This brought Didi, who lived in a kindergarten and taught English to help cover the rent, into contact with a broad spectrum of people.
 "It was very difficult at that time to get food and just survive. There were many people living on the streets nearby, in my garden, on my doorstep. I got to meet a lot of people and so I got to know what was going on," she recalls. "There was a lot of alcoholism, sexual abuse, mothers with a lot of different partners, homeless families in which the kids would get into trouble, young girls prostituting themselves because it was difficult to avoid.
 "I got to know the pimps, too. Some of the girls would become pimps themselves. There were murders; many of them get involved in murders," she continues in her quiet, matter-of-fact way. "And because it's so horrifying to see this sort of thing happening, I started thinking about how to get them off the streets and out of the vulnerable situations."
 Once Didi moved out of the kindergarten and into a small flat, the street kids she'd come to know began dropping by. She would help them with their health problems and cook for them -- even the food they stole and brought with them.
 Her moment of epiphany came on Children's Day, June 1, 1994. "It's a day when families dress up and go to the park together but these kids didn't have anywhere to go and they all showed up at my place. I felt a bit sad that I couldn't offer them anything."
 Within a year, Didi had founded her first Lotus House and the first youngster she took in was a 15-year-old girl whose violent, alcoholic father had pushed her on to the streets to earn money. Within weeks, the number of Lotus House residents had grown to 15, including half a dozen babies, many of whom still know only Didi as mum.
 Money remained a problem. So every now and then Didi would go to Taiwan, where Ananda Marga is well established, to "sing in the street, and once I got $40,000 and that kept me going for a couple of years". But it didn't keep her going in any sort of comfort or style.
 Damien Wohlfarht, an Australian working in Ulaanbaatar as chief technical adviser of the UN Population Fund, remembers visiting Didi around Christmas 1997, soon after he arrived in Mongolia. "Lotus House occupied three jerry-built houses and cold air seeped in around the windows and through the cracked brick walls. The smoky interior stank of sulphur dioxide from the leaky small coal stove.
 "The place was very spartan, with only a few bits of old furniture. The older girls slept on floor mats. There was no running water; the toilet was an outside pit latrine.
 "Many of the tots had rickets to varying degrees, so they were quite delayed in their walking. Most of the children were unable to go to school -- the local teachers wouldn't accept them because street children must be trouble-makers."
 The conditions -- overcrowding, cold, lack of water -- took their toll and some of the children died from a variety of ills, including syphilis, meningitis and food poisoning.
 For a long time Didi toiled alone. Teenage girls were given babies to look after. A woman with nine children came to stay and, paradoxically, helped ease the burden of childcare.
 Word got around and now a handful of volunteers, including wet nurses, regularly help out. Didi employs a couple of local people full-time, and her monthly wage bill comes to $300, an enormous outlay by Mongolian standards.
 In late 1997, Wohlfarht helped Didi apply for a grant of almost $50,000 from AusAID, the Australian Government's aid agency, towards the two new buildings that were completed in February last year.
 "I didn't know you could get these sort of grants," says Didi, "and I had no idea of how to fill in the forms."
But no matter how much better Lotus House looks on the outside, it is merely a cocoon amid all the deprivation and squalor that has, over the past decade, become the norm in Mongolia. Once one of the most powerful nations on earth, its economy collapsed when Soviet forces withdrew.
 Mongolia became completely dependent on its communist big brother during the 70 years it was a vassal state of the USSR.
 The nomads, who make up almost half the population of 2.4 million, raised cows, goats, sheep and horses to provide milk, meat and wool for the Soviet army. Mongolia's vast reserves of coal and copper were mined and sent as fuel and fodder to Russian factories. Mongolians worked in Soviet-built industries and relied on Soviet markets to take the third-rate goods they produced.
 Successive Mongolian stooges of Joseph Stalin gave away chunks of territory and swapped Mongolian writing and language for Cyrillic and Russian. Mongolia's best and brightest were educated in Moscow and East Berlin. Even now many older Mongolians speak Russian and German better than they do their mother tongue.
 As the USSR began to split asunder in 1989, Mongolians, like their repressed counterparts across Eastern Europe, took to the streets to demand democracy. On December 10, 1989, the peaceful protests began in Ulaanbaatar's central Sukhbaatar Square. Residents braved the freezing cold to stand, in 20-minute shifts, in front of the mausoleum that holds the remains of strongman Marshall Choibalsan to demand that the puppet government step down.
 Within months, the Politburo had voted itself out of power and called elections. The Communist Party's reformist wing was voted in and a new era of democracy began. Soviet forces pulled out, leaving behind them the empty shell of 70 years of socialism. The 30,000 troops, bureaucrats and experts took with them the support system that had kept Mongolia afloat.
 Without access to Soviet subsidies, Soviet markets or even Soviet spare parts for the Soviet-built factories, Mongolia's economy quickly unravelled, prompting a social descent into joblessness, drunkenness, child abuse, spousal battery, assault, theft, rape and murder. Families were torn apart and the streets became unsafe after dark. Unemployment in some areas is more than
60 per cent among people aged 18 to 35.
 By 1993, when Didi arrived, no amount of money could buy food in shops; there wasn't any to buy. Inflation was more than 200 per cent. For those who joined the queues, the price of what was left when they reached the counter was higher than it was when they first lined up.
 Urban residents could rely only on their relatives in the countryside to supply them with food, invariably mutton, to get them through the long winter months. Even now, amid a proliferation of bars, restaurants and markets selling everything from Chinese turnips to Italian prosciutto, it is not unusual for people in Ulaanbaatar to bring live sheep and goats back from a visit to their tent-dwelling relatives on the vast steppes, which they slaughter and keep on their balconies.
 For the homeless, however, there is no safety net. Experts in Ulaanbaatar say about 1000 children live on the streets. The sole government orphanage is overcrowded and the children there are vulnerable to abuse.
 A number of Western organisations have stepped in to help fill the void, notably Irish orphan Christina Noble, whose Children's Foundation at the opposite end of town provides a stark contrast to Didi's Lotus House, testimony to Noble's high international profile and ability to attract publicity and donations.
 At Noble's Blue Skies compound, a dozen or so pristine gers stand in a circle, some home to just three or four teenagers, some serving as school rooms for as few as eight children at a time. A new shower and lavatory block stands beyond the playground. A Mercedes four-wheel-drive, donated by Mercedes in Ireland, is parked by the gate.
 The gulf between Blue Skies and Lotus House was highlighted after a small cocktail party thrown by Ambassador Smith for the Australian community in Ulaanbaatar; Didi swept the leftover food into a plastic shopping bag to take home for those she calls "my girls".
 About 20 foreign non-government organisations, including Save The Children and World Vision, now supplement the 40 Mongolian NGOs involved in child welfare.
 The wife of a former prime minister, Erenjav Shurentsetseg, has set up the Tsetseg Children's Fund, Mongolia's first effort at homegrown philanthropy, which has so far helped finance 47 projects for 7000 children. The fund's activities range from helping drop-outs in rural areas get back to school, supplementing teachers' incomes, medical and dental programs and a centre for disabled children.
 Despite all the aid -- more than $US1.1billion has poured into Mongolia in the past decade -- little headway is being made, according to Shurentsetseg. "In the early 1990s, the situation was better than now. Mongolians were not so poor and the divide between rich and poor was not so wide as it is now," she says.
 Nor are the problems that have led to widespread homelessness new. "During the socialist time, these problems existed but there was no openness. Since 1990, there has emerged a culture of openness.
 "Some people say that because of democracy and the market economy, our children are dropping out of school. But this is not true. The main reason is the lack of responsibility of parents for the care of their children.
 "During the socialist time, the state controlled how children should be brought up. During that time, people became lazy, they didn't work for themselves, they just waited for handouts. But now we have to work for ourselves, not just ask the state to give us everything. In this transition period, things are difficult, but it is getting better -- people's mentality is slowing changing."
