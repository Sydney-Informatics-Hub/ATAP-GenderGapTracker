HOPES rose for some former workers from the National Textiles factory at Rutherford yesterday after another textile manufacturer said it would employ 20 people to fulfil an Olympics contract.
 Wax Converters Textiles Ltd announced yesterday that one of its subsidiaries, Banner Images, had been awarded a contract to produce thousands of Olympic banners and flags.
A spokesman for the National Textiles workers said: "If anyone can get employment that is good news.
 "It would be great if 20 National Textiles workers got work. The entitlements are one thing, but the lack of jobs is killing them. Entitlements don't give you peace of mind, direction, any thought that you are productive anymore."
 Barry Tubner, secretary of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, said National Textiles had not tendered for "a lot" of Olympic contracts it could have won.
 "It was as if they wanted the factory to close," he said. "A few pieces of the jigsaw don't go together."
 Mai-Wel, a service organisation for people with disabilities in the Maitland area, said it would experience long-term difficulties because of the money it was owed by the failed textiles firm.
 The money, $5075, is for ground maintenance of the National Textiles site at Rutherford done between last August and January.
 A team of five people with disabilities plus a supervisor worked there once a month.
 Mai-Wel organiser Bob Manson said directors at Nat ional Textiles had "one hell of a lot to answer for".
