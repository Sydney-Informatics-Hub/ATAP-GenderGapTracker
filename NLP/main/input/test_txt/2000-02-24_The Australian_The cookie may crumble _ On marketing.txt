INTERNET marketing has hit some turbulence. Big marketers have been hastening to unravel the grand theory of who behaves precisely how and when on the Internet. Thanks to the practice of Internet profiling, commercial voyeurs of consumer behaviour have made extraordinary leaps in their understanding of what makes people tick. The problem they now face is whether the freedom they have in tracking individuals online will be outlawed.
The behaviour of the world's biggest online advertising company, DoubleClick, may just emerge as the catalyst for a backlash. Last week, the company's share price dropped 18 per cent the day the US Federal Trade Commission confirmed it was investigating whether DoubleClick was engaged in unfair or deceptive practices in its efforts to gather intimate details about Internet users. Privacy advocates argue DoubleClick has been illegally fusing behavioural data from Internet users with personal profiles on a sophisticated offline marketing database derived from catalogue purchases and magazine subscriptions. Through its $US1.7 billion ($2.6 billion) acquisition of database group, Abacus Direct, DoubleClick wants to build a bigger, slicker database of consumers that will include their names, addresses, demographic details and retail, catalogue and online purchasing histories. Abacus already has 2 billion consumer catalogue transactions logged on its system while DoubleClick has at least 100 million cookies scattered throughout the Internet recording individual Web users' surfing behaviour. (Cookies are small data files placed on hard drives by Internet servers that contain specific user information.)
 Traditionally, DoubleClick has used this data to target the placement of online banner ads to relevant online users -- people with cookies showing they were fans of tennis-related Web sites, for example, would be identified by DoubleClick as prime candidates for receiving sports-related advertising. With its latest plans to merge the Abacus database, DoubleClick would know those users' names, where they lived, whether they had bought shoes from a certain catalogue, if so, how long ago the last purchase was made, and whether it was time for a marketer to make an unsolicited offer online. The industry argues this is better for the consumer because it allows tighter targeting. But serious questions are being raised about how transparent online companies are in gaining permission from individual online users to monitor and store their online behaviour and share it with others for marketing exercises.
 Web users, for example, are not informed when DoubleClick places cookies on their machines unless their Web browsers are preset to do so. In many instances, such as with Microsoft's Hotmail e-mail service, manually disabling cookies makes access to e-mail nigh impossible. If too many people were to disable their cookies, it would severely restrict Web companies' ability to deliver specific data about what online users are doing and limit their selling potential to marketing clients.
 "It's about reaching people at the point of contact [where] they are looking for certain types of information," says Yahoo!'s worldwide marketing head, Karen Edwards, who is on a visit to Australia. "If we want, we can really create [marketing offers] practically down to the individual user. We're going to charge [companies] for that; it will be a higher per contact cost, but we can do it."
 Yahoo! gathers much of its profiling information through its registration process, where its 120 million members worldwide proffer personal information and choose to allow Yahoo! to use that information to make offers. Yahoo! is deliberately being less gung-ho about its online marketing tactics for fear of annoying its customers. "We're really, really freakish about not over-communicating to our users or spamming [sending junk e-mail to] our users," Edwards. "We're really gun-shy. We don't give out information on individuals and we don't sell our lists or rent our lists. We do, however, allow advertisers to buy a particular audience. A company like McDonald's could say, 'Give us all the women who are a certain age, who live in a particular zip code, who seem to have an interest in child-rearing' and we could create a family-orientated promotion or package. We have a variety of ways we can target these people directly."
 Edwards says targeted promotions will only be sent to people who have agreed to receive such offers during their registration. The problem with many online companies is that the ability for users to "opt in" or "opt out" of the tracking process is either buried or biased towards the affirmative. The danger these companies face in being too aggressive in their use of tracking, targeting and selling technology is that too many unwanted offers will turn people off the rapid commercialisation of the Web. On the flipside, the disincentive at present for companies to pull back their marketing efforts is that this targeting technology is working its pants off in terms of consumer response rates. Edwards cites the Yahoo! branded Visa card as a case in point.
 When the card launched two years ago, Yahoo! primarily used banner ads on its own site to sell the product without too much targeting of the audience. But after analysing the types of people who were taking up the credit card offer, Yahoo! started making offers to people with similar profiles to those who had already signed up. Response rates quadrupled. Edwards says Yahoo! has worked out how many offers each Yahoo! member should receive before they hit the annoyance zone, but won't reveal the number. The other thing she won't say about Yahoo!'s caution in online direct marketing is that the company is allowing rivals to push the envelop harder in online profiling and marketing to minimise any fallout for Yahoo!. It appears DoubleClick may just be fulfilling that role.
