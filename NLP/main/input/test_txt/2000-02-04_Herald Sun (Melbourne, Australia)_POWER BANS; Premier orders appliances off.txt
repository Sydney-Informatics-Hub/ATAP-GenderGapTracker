POWER bans were slapped on home electrical equipment by Premier Steve Bracks today.
 Householders cannot use a wide range of everyday appliances including air conditioning, video recorders, personal computers, clothes dryers and dishwashers.
 Mr Bracks took the action as the temperature climbed towards 39 deg. and the weather bureau predicted more high temperatures for next week.
 The level one bans under the state's Electrical Industry Act apply from 1pm until 7pm.
The restrictions will not apply over the weekend but will come into force again from Monday and be reviewed after Wednesday next week.
 Any person breaching the order faces fines of up to $10,000 under the Act, which was passed in the wake of the 1998 Longford gas crisis.
 There will be special exemption for people with disabilities, the elderly and people caring for babies.
 The Government has set up an advice line for those who believe they may be eligible for exemptions. The number is 1800 634 245.
 "The State Government has taken this action in an attempt to avoid the interruptions in supply which occurred in Victoria yesterday," Mr Bracks said.
 "We have a serious situation in Victoria and (want to) ensure that we don't have these problems again."
 Industry has been ordered not to use air-conditioning and decorative lighting.
 Mr Bracks also gave the unions and Yallourn Energy a deadline of midnight Sunday to resolve their dispute which has closed down the Yallourn power station.
 If not the Government is prepared to force a return to work under emergency powers to get full power flowing from the plant.
 The bans come into force as the five electricity supply companies again prepapred to implement rolling bans across the state, following yesterday's record demand.
 Anger over the failure to warn consumers of power cuts resulted in national power regulator National Electricity Marketing Management Company agreeing to a five-minute warning for all householders.

 Lights will flicker for five seconds before full power cuts hit five minutes later.
 "The government has obviously had a look at the forecast into next week and has decided that's the best thing they can do," said NEMMCO spokesman Paul Price.
 The Country Fire Authority advised all consumers to turn electrical devices off at the switch the moment they are hit by a power cut.
 Crisis talks between unions and Yallourn Energy began this morning at the Premier's Department, mediated by former Cain government minister Neil Pope.
 But after two hours union officials said privately there had been no movement from the company, which is seeking to introduce private contractors.
 Police put all available uniform officers on traffic duties and promised the force was ready to respond to all calls for help if traffic lights were again hit by power cuts.
 The distribution companies said earlier today they could not give more than five minutres warning before cuts kicked in.
 Powercor spokesman Hugo Armstrong told the Herald Sun the stoppages would again be random.
 "It's very unpredictable, we won't know until it happens," he said.
 "All we can say is for everybody to prepare in whatever way is appropriate for when the power is cut."
 Mr Armstrong said those hit yesterday could expect to suffer again today, with rolling blackouts across the suburbs.
 United Energy said its areas affected would include East Malvern, Burwood, East Burwwood, Carrum, Cheltenham, Doncaster, Dandenong, Elsternwick, Elwood, Frankston, Frankston South, Heatherton, Gardener, Mentone and Mulgrave.
 Citipower said most of its customers in the inner suburbs again faced rolling cuts.
 Hospitals, the Central Business District and emergency services will not be affected.
 Some large companies, lead by Ford at Broadmeadows and Geelong, have voluntarily ceased production to preserve power.
 Dean Mighell of the Electrical Trades Union accused Yallourn Energy of igniting the dispute and deliberately cutting power to turn Victorians against the energy workers.
 "I think it is no coincidence Yallourn Energy started this dispute at the hottest time of the year," he said.
 "The Victorian community is being set up by the power company so they can force pay cuts and attack conditions on their workers.
 He said there was no reason why Victorians should suffer cuts.
 "They have the technology. We believe they could have looked at alternatives."
 Mr Bracks was briefed after arriving from the World Economic Forum and decided on the compulsory powers this morning.
