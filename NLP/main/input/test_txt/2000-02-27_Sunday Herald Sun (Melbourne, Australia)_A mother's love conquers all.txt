Alison Lapper has no arms, under-developed legs and a big responsibility. She has just given birth, but wants no one's blessing or charity. FIONA WINGETT reports
ALISON Lapper will never be able to hold her baby. She will never swing him in the air and cuddle him the way other parents can, or chase him around the park and catch him when he falls.
 The talented painter and sculptor was born with no arms and tiny, shortened legs. Yet, at 34, she has become a single mother.
She knows she could not cope without a live-in nanny to place baby Parys Alan George on her breast for feeds, or to guide her when she bathes him or to help change his nappy.
 She is having to learn new skills -- not least to deal with the disapproval she knows her motherhood brings from some quarters.
 Alison acknowledges there is a stigma attached to Parys' birth, but becomes angry if she hears suggestions from passers-by that she can not look after him properly.
 "What is the proper way to look after a child?" she said. "I cuddle him my way. Why do people jump to these conclusions? It makes me so angry.
 "How do they know I can't look after my baby? They are just ignorant. The state isn't paying for him. I am paying for my own nanny.
 "People should stop being so damned bigoted. They don't know me. They are making judgments about me -- I don't judge them."
 But is there not a danger her child may all too soon become her carer?
 "That's a hideous thought. I didn't have him so he could become my carer," she said.
 "I've successfully lived on my own for 10 years. I don't need him to 'do' for me. I'm here to do for him."
 Alison was born without arms as a result of phocomelia, a congenital condition similar to that caused by thalidomide.
 Alison's mother, Veronica, was told her daughter was deformed and would die and that she should forget she had had a baby.
 "It was out of her control," Alison said. "The system took me away from my mother because that's what they did then with children like me."
 She was put into care, but her mother tracked her down when she was three.
 More than 30 years later, the baby taken from her is a woman with enormous blue eyes, fine cheekbones and spiky, close-cropped, bleached-blonde hair. She is also feisty and, in her own words, "cocky".
 She is an artist -- painting designs for Christmas cards -- who studied at university, has a ring through her nose, is a keen horse rider and an advanced driver.
 She is also a divorcee, from a marriage at 22 which, after only six months, "didn't work out".
 Her home, a seaside bungalow in West Sussex, England, is a patchwork of color. Her living room has shocking yellow walls, and there are images of bodies, either painted or sculpted, everywhere.
 Surrounded by handicapped children at a special school in East Sussex, where she lived from the age of six weeks to 17, Alison did not realise she was disabled until she was about 12.
 H ER childhood was undeniably tough. She never knew her father -- he left before she was born.
 At seven months, she was fitted with rudimentary prosthetic arms. By the age of two, the arms had hooks on the ends and were gas-powered. As she grew, the gas cylinders became bigger and bigger.
 "They wanted us to look normal, yet made us look like Daleks (robots from the Doctor Who television series)," she said. "We were strange little creatures."
 Alison, who has an elder sister, Vanessa, was able to see her family only three times a year.
 It was not until she went "into the real world" that she knew there was something different about her.
 But it did not stop her studying and becoming an artist, from going nightclubbing with her friends, then deciding at 23 she did not need the false limbs.
 Ten years later, when she had come to terms with the thought that she would never have children, she discovered she was pregnant.
 She refuses to name the father, saying only they had been seeing each other for a few months when she found she was expecting.
 "He was around for quite a few months of the pregnancy, but he's not now," she said.
 "I suppose it would be more ideal if he was still here, but I don't want anything to do with him.
 "If Parys wants to get in touch with him when he gets older, I don't have a problem."
 She is, quite simply, "loved up" with her "little man".
 But there is also the suspicion that she has so much to prove to her doubters that she would never admit to being overwhelmed by the prospect.
 She said she was terrified when she found out she was pregnant. "I thought 'what am I going to do, should I have him?' And, 'how will I cope?' I was in a panic."
 She decided against an abortion, knowing she had coped with her disability all her life.
 "I'm so glad I didn't go through with it," she said. "He was an accident, but a happy one."
 The pregnancy was "a breeze" and Alison carried her baby as long as she could -- to 35 weeks -- before she had a caesarean.
 "I had to have him then because I just couldn't get around," she said.
 "It tested my body to the limit and it affected my mobility so much in the last weeks -- getting off the sofa, showering myself, using the lavatory -- the doctors decided to deliver him then."
 The birth had its complications. A drip had to be inserted into a vein in her neck.
 "It was incredibly scary. I'm not sure I'd want to do it again tomorrow," she said.
 "But when they put Parys on my chest in the recovery room, it blew my mind. He was put on my breast and I could touch him with my shoulder. It was an amazing feeling.
 "They always talk about the love you have for your child being unlike any other -- and I finally understood.
 "It is a whole little life I am responsible for. Rather than being daunted by it, I know I can do a good job or screw it up -- we all can -- but I want to do the best job."
 Alison knew before Parys was born that he had not inherited her condition, but it would not have worried her if he had.
 "But I'm glad he hasn't, more for him than for me, because it will make his life easier," she said.
 "Naturally, I really want the best for him, although I think it's a shame we think that everyone has to be so damned perfect."
 S HE does not know what the future holds. "I'm a person who lives for the day and sees what happens."
 Alison already has had to deal with the reactions of people she meets in the street, who assume the baby belongs to her nanny.
 "When you tell them he's actually mine and see their reaction, it hurts," she said.
 "I am self-employed, so I can give Parys time. That's the most important thing.
 "I've never wished that I could have had arms to hold him, because that would make me sad.
 "I hope I can make up for it in other ways. After all, arms aren't the be-all and end-all."
