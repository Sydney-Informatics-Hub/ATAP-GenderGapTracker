HOPES rose for some former workers from the National Textiles factory at Rutherford yesterday after another textile manufacturer said it would employ 20 people to fulfil an Olympics contract.
 Wax Converters Textiles Ltd announced yesterday that one of its subsidiaries, Banner Images, had been awarded a contract to produce thousands of Olympic banners and flags.
 A spokesman for the National Textiles workers welcomed the small hope of work.
"If anyone can get employment that is good news," he said.
 "It would be great if 20 National Textiles workers got work. The entitlements is one thing, but the lack of jobs is killing them. Entitlements don't give you peace of mind, direction, any thought that you are productive anymore."
 Secretary of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, Barry Tubner, said National Textiles had not tendered for "a lot" of Olympic contracts it could have won.
 "It was as if they wanted the factory to close," he said. "A few pieces of the jigsaw don't go together with National Textiles."
 Mai-Wel, a service organisation for people with disabilities in the Maitland area, said it would experience long-term difficulties because of the money it was owed by the failed textiles firm.
 The money -- $5075 -- is for ground maintenance of the National Textiles site at Rutherford done between August 1999 and January.
 A team of five people with disabilities plus a supervisor worked there once a month.
 Mai-Wel organiser Bob Manson said that although the maintenance team had been paid, this left the organisation short.It may only receive 2c in the dollar and this could take three years to receive.
 Mr Manson said directors at National Textiles had "one hell of a lot to answer for".
 It had been common knowledge that the company had been struggling since 1995. He said he wished the firm had informed Mai-Wel that ground maintenance was not high on its agenda and there could be difficulty in paying.
