LIZ Wielgosz gives thanks every day she did not have a pre-natal test to learn if her baby had Down syndrome.
 Three hours after her son was born, she was told he did have the condition.
 Daniel, now 6, has changed his mother's life.
"I would never, ever give him up," Ms Wielgosz said.
 "Any child that you have changes the dynamics of a family.
 "I've learnt a lot from Daniel, more understanding, tolerance. He just brings out such pure qualities in people.
 "Sure it's not easy, but it's worth it, and every day is just a day I'm blessed to have him and I wouldn't change that for the world."
 Ms Wielgosz said quicker tests would give couples more time to seek information about Down syndrome.
 "It will let people make the decision and with quicker testing it will give them some more time to make that choice," she said.
 "They can get educated and find out what it is like having a child with Down syndrome."
 But she feared if general screening was introduced people would use it to terminate babies with genetic abnormalities.
 "Will they say: 'Oh my God, I'm having a disabled child. Let's abort'?" she asked.
 But if people wanted to test for chromosome abnormalities then it should be made available, Ms Wielgosz said.
 "It's not the parents and it's not the child. It's society. Our children can do anything if they are just given a chance," she said.
 "I don't know what my thoughts would have been then (if she had had a test), because I didn't know Daniel and I didn't know anything about Down syndrome.
 "But even if I did have a test I don't think I would have done it (terminated). I can't go back, and frankly, I don't want to go back."
