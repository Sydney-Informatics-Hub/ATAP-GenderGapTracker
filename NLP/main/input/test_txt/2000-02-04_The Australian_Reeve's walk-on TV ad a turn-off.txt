PARALYSED Superman star Christopher Reeve has defended his role in a controversial television commercial after being accused of offering false hope to disabled people.
 The advertisement for Nuveen Investments shows a computer-generated image of Reeve rising from his wheelchair to walk again, and has caused widespread disquiet since it was first aired during the national broadcast of the US Superbowl on Monday.

Dozens of paralysed people and their relatives rushed to call spinal injury groups after seeing the advertisement, believing scientists had found a miracle cure.
 "While it's difficult, we have to tell them the truth: Christopher Reeve is not walking. He is still paralysed, he's still on a respirator," a National Spinal Cord Injury Association spokesman said.
 "I thought it was a fabulous idea, because it really is a vision of something that can happen," said Reeve, who has been paralysed from the chest down since a horse-riding accident five years ago.
 "It's like the difference between looking at a blueprint and looking at a detailed model of a new house.
 "And you can imagine yourself living there," he said.
 When he first saw the advertisement, Reeve said he had mixed emotions: "There was a lot of reaching for Kleenex afterwards … I was elated. I was deeply moved."
 Although his computer-generated body was a "little stockier" than he would have liked, he said, the advertisement was a "remarkable job technically".
 Nuveen Investments is spending $US7 million ($10.5million) on the advertising campaign, which urges investors to "leave your mark" on society and think about the future when buying stocks and shares.
