In Melbourne's eastern suburbs, volunteers are giving pre-loved computers new and useful lives.
 Based in the old council work sheds at Ringwood, the Equipment Recycling Network Inc. is affectionately known as "Erni".
 Its team of 23 volunteers is co-ordinated by Susan McKoy, recently awarded the Deakin 2000 Australia Day Award for her service to the community.
The group provides computers and computer accessories for a small charge to cover costs to people with disabilities, especially children, who have been referred by doctors or other health service providers.
 Erni is always looking for more donations and sturdy and reliable 486s are welcomed, as well as Pentiums and laptops.
 The volunteers, who can expect to be rewarded in coffee, chocolate cake and "lots of hugs and thank yous", clean the hard drives of the donated computers and then reload them with public domain software.
 For families struggling to survive on a pension or pay high medical expenses, a low-cost computer could make a big difference, Mrs McKoy said.
 An old 486 can help someone stay in touch by e-mail, continue studying or simply write letters. Laptops are particularly useful for people confined to bed or in wheelchairs.
 Charges are kept low and occasionally people are in such financial straits a computer will be provided free. Often these people will demand to pay something towards the cost of their new pre-loved PC.
 "We had a client who insisted on paying for her computer at the rate of $2 a week," Mrs McKoy said.
 The gratitude of Erni's clients is sticky-taped around the former shower recess and bathroom walls. There are "thank you" drawings from children, photos and letters from families and small gifts, such as a tiny ribbon-wrapped wish marble.
 Donations come from individuals, businesses, universities, schools and hospitals.
 Ewen Bell, whose company TwoCats hosts the group's website, has asked his corporate clients to donate equipment.
 Obtaining equipment, spare parts, transportation and technical support is an exercise in perpetual motion for Erni's volunteers.
 On a wet and rainy day in Mt Waverley last December, a passer-by noticed that Micros Fidelio Australia was moving offices and had dumped unwanted 3.11 and W95 software licences into a garbage skip.
 The passer-by contacted Erni and Mrs McKoy leaped into her car to recover the treasure trove.
 Later, damp but happy, she not only had the back seat full of software licences, but had more donations from the company.
 Probably the group's most loyal supporter is Maroondah Council which provides funds, legal and business support.
 The rest of the money that Erni needs to keep going is raised by selling chocolates and firewood, charity auctions and shopping tours.
 The Equipment Recycling Network Inc welcomes volunteers, donors or requests for help.
 And the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition website gives reasons to recycle rather than dump PCs. Read the FAQ and statistics on a PC's innards, including what toxic gases and metals, biologically active materials, acids and plastics lurk under that friendly desktop.
