GEOFFREY Meyer says he believes online learning and flexible delivery of information is the future of education -- and he is attempting to make that future a reality.
 Having developed an award-winning, Web-based computer-aided learning program for histology students, the senior lecturer in the University of Western Australia's department of anatomy and human biology is adapting it to produce an online high school course in human biology.
 Dr Meyer is also collaborating with two colleagues at the Cerebral Palsy Centre in Perth to develop online high school courses to help disabled students obtain access to more resources than they would otherwise be able to and is looking at the feasibility of using his program to permit students to have access to university courses from distant locations, even from other countries.
"I am currently negotiating the delivery of an online histology course that students can enrol in from anywhere in the world that will give them credit towards their degree at whatever institution they are attending," said Dr Meyer.
 "Many institutions like the idea because, until now, their students were deprived of such a course due to the enormous cost of buying all the microscopes and slide collections you need, maintaining the equipment and hiring all the staff.
 "Eventually I see any member of the community being able to [obtain] access [to] most of our educational resources. I believe this is an excellent goal for universities as part of our role in community education programs."
 Dr Meyer was named joint winner of the Federal Government's Australian Awards for University Teaching in the flexible delivery-teaching category in November.
 This commitment to teaching explains why he spent his Christmas holidays at the University of California at Los Angeles medical school.
