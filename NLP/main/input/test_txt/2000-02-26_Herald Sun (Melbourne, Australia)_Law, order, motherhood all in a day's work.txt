GABY Tomkin is perhaps best described as an organised achiever.
 A successful property lawyer and mother of two pre-school children, Gaby has branched out into the competitive world of residential home construction with some amazing results in the past three years.
 It is not surprising considering Gaby, 36, is the daughter of Alex Tomkin, the managing director of prominent Victorian company Tomkin Homes.
 But although Gaby has moved into home construction, she is not part of a well established family business.
"I like to be independent," she said. "I suppose I have inherited a few ideas about home building from my father such as his slow and conservative approach.
 "I also have followed his advice on never over-committing on borrowings and sticking to what you know about the business.
 "You have to be so careful. I spent 10 years as a property lawyer cleaning up other people's mistakes."
 It was Gaby's legal work that took her to Dallas, Texas, 10 years ago and a plum job in the then US Secretary of State James Baker's law firm.
 Her husband John had been transferred to Dallas and Gaby did not want to be without him for two years, so she followed.
 "I was the first foreign lawyer to be paid. There were more than 1000 lawyers working in the firm. I sat my bar examination and have my US qualifications," she said.
 Part of her salary package in cluded a free psychiatric visit each week, an offer she did not take up.
 But after two years she became homesick for Melbourne.
 "We had our honeymoon on the way back to Australia and then we got married on our return," she says.
 Four years ago, about the time she was pregnant with eldest daughter Lauren, husband John set up his own legal firm, Fetter Gdanski, with Gaby as a consultant.
 After Lauren's birth, she worked two days a week but she quickly found it was impossible to do legal work part-time.
 She turned her attention to renovating John's old bachelor pad in Elwood and found she enjoyed the work.
 They then bought a block of land in Brighton on which her father built their home -- and the introduction to home construction began.
 "We have moved seven times in six years," Gaby said.
 Among her achievements to date have been the completion of six townhouses in Hampton, six in Brunswick and four in Moonee Ponds.
 And while these projects were growing, Gaby also found time to give birth to their second daughter Nicole, now 2.
 But it is the latest project at 194 Alma Rd, East St Kilda, which is Gaby's pride and joy.
 The 24 apartments, half of which have already been sold off the plan by agent John Kaufman of Wilson Pride, Caulfield, will be finished by June 30. They are priced from $197,000
 "Don't worry, that's the deadline and they will be finished," Gaby said confidently.
 And how does this, attractive mother-of-two cope with the building site hard hats?
 Very well, it seems.
 "They are all pussycats. Being a woman is a definite advantage. It's important to use what you've got in business," she said.
 Daughter Nicole is sometimes the wild card in the equation.
 "I take her on site and after about an hour she gets restless so everyone knows the time constraints," Gaby said.
 Gaby also likes to vary house design to suit the local area.
 For instance, the Hampton townhouses will have a "beachy" look -- part rendered, part brick.
 "I like lots of light and space. Homes should be usable and multi-functional," she adds.
 But large-scale property developers need not worry -- Gaby is not planning a take-over.
 "These 24 townhouses in Alma Rd are the biggest single project I want to tackle. If I have to delegate responsibility to others I feel I can't rely on them. I need to be in control," she said.
 "Anyway, I'd miss out too much on playing with my kids," says Gaby, who still finds time to do work for ACCESS, a charity which helps disabled children return to school.
