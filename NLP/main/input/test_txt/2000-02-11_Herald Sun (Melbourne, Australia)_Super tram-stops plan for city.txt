YARRA Trams has plans for "super stops" with sheltered platforms, kiosks, ticketing machines and better access for disabled passengers.
 The plan includes a new color scheme and refurbishment for trams in a move to attract more passengers.
Chief executive officer Steven MacDonald would not reveal the new color scheme yesterday but said the traditional timber finish on the old W-class trams would go.
 "It's going to be a much more modern look," he said.
 Mr MacDonald said the company hoped to begin introducing super stops within six months.
 About 30 sites, mostly in the central business district, have been earmarked for the special stops.
 Yarra Trams will also begin a trial called "park and ride", which will entice passengers to drive to a major stop and then take the tram.
 Mr MacDonald said the company had found two areas either side of the city to allow the trial to happen within six months.
 Mr MacDonald has also raised the possibility of daily tickets being sold at tram stops.
 Swanston Trams will also launch several initiatives this year to make its service more user friendly.
 Its first refurbished tram is scheduled for service early next year.
