THERE was plenty of animated conversation when Greg Norman and Peter Senior paired for yesterday's final round.
 Norman's putting woes received an airing, but the hot topic was a Huntingdale layout which failed to inspire pleasant memories for the men who have collectively won 102 tournaments worldwide, including eight Australian Masters.
 Senior went on the record to describe Huntingdale as "mickey mouse". Craig Parry was fined for slamming the course last year and another senior player, Rodger Davis, criticised the changes after Thursday's round.
"I've always looked forward to coming to Huntingdale, but it's become a bit mickey mouse," Senior said.
 "The number of good shots I've seen finish 30ft away this week is ridiculous . . . it's just not on. They've gone overboard. You don't need to build huge mountains and swales in the greens.
 "They say it was for drainage, but you don't need 10ft mountains in the greens for drainage. The greens here used to be the fastest and flattest we played and it got difficult when they got hard.
 "But now you're penalised for a good shot. They put the pin placements in spots where you can go a metre past the hole, catch a swale and finish 10m away."
 Norman said he and Senior, the only players to have won more than $2 million in Australia, had discussed the varying speed of the greens.
 "You have seven different putting surfaces, so you have seven different speeds," Norman said.
 Norman said continuing changes would make the course different every time players returned for the next five Masters.
 "I've always believed that if you're going to make a change, do it at the one time. Are you pregnant, or half-pregnant?
 "I understand their philosophy about the drainage, but this course is going to be different every time we come back for a lot of years."
 Norman, who would not commit himself to next year's Masters, raised a cheer on the 16th fairway when he spotted a disabled spectator in a wheelchair, fetched a glove from his bag, signed it and walked into the crowd to give it to the man.
