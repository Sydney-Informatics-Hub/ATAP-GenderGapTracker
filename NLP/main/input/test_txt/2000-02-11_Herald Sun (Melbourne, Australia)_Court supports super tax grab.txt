THE tax office could tax the superannuation of a permanently disabled woman, the High Court ruled yesterday.
 Four of five judges backed an Australian Taxation Office argument that the lump sum of $164,957 paid to Melbourne woman Lynette Scully was actually an eligible termination payment.

Ms Scully, an employee of the RACV, suffered severe brain damage in a car accident in July 1992.
 In 1993, RACV Superannuation agreed to pay on the ground of total and permanent disablement.
 The ATO said tax of $12,452 should be paid on top of $2664 originally deducted.
 The Federal Court originally rejected the view of the ATO, which then appealed to the High Court.
 At issue was whether the payment could be properly characterised as "consideration of a capital nature for or in respect of personal injury to the taxpayer". If so, it would not be taxed.
 The majority ruled that it was not, saying the payment was calculated in consideration of termination of employment not by reference to the nature and extent of injury or likely future loss of earnings.
 "In our opinion the payment in this case cannot be characterised as 'consideration . . . in respect of personal injury'," they said.
 Justice Michael Kirby was the sole dissenter, again criticising a literal interpretation of the tax legislation.
 He said the Tax Act could hardly be described as a pristine model of symmetry and internal cohesion.
 "The scheme of the Act as it now stands suggests a general legislative purpose to treat receipts by the taxpayer from a superannuation fund beneficially and protectively where they are 'in respect of . . . personal injury to the taxpayer' or in circumstances where the employment of the taxpayer has been terminated 'because of physical or mental incapacity to engage in that employment'," he said.
