The Big Picture: This Is Modern Art
(9.30pm Thursday, Two)
AS British writer-presenter Matthew Collings admits in his introduction to this six-part (!) series, modern art by its own definition defies description. For example, can "modern art" that was created 50 years ago still be considered modern? And if it has become something else, what is it? Collings, himself an artist although he looks and sometimes sounds more like a sardonic stand-up comedian, takes the view that modern art is something constantly evolving. In the first episode, he traces the life and work of modern art's three great heroes, Picasso, Pollock and Andy Warhol. Viewers with a fondness for the art form may sit through six weeks of this detailed introspection. Those unimpressed by its vagaries and excesses should give it a miss.
Leylands' Australia
(6.30pm Sunday, Nine)
THE Leyland name is synonymous around Australia with TV and travel. Back in the '70s, Mike and Mal Leyland pioneered the travel show format with their popular series Ask the Leyland Brothers. Hardly looking a day older, Mal returns to the screen without Mike but with other family members for a six-part camping and caravanning expedition from Brisbane to Kununurra in northern Western Australia. His fellow journeyers this time are wife Laraine, daughter Carmen and Carmen's husband, Robert Scott, all sharing the role of reporter-presenter. And therein lies Leylands' Australia's biggest drawback. No doubt stung by criticism of Mike and Mal's quick, broad manner of speech all those years ago, the 2000 Leylands have all had elocution lessons that make them sound like they're talking to the intellectually disabled. The result is something so stilted that it's hard to get involved even in some of the quaint out-of-the-way places they visit.
 Profiler: San Brisas
(10.30pm Monday, Seven)
 PROGRAMMERS often throw two episodes together to fill a hole but this two-hour screening is a genuine one-story show that brings the season to another cliffhanger ending. After a girl sends her a message to "please find my mummy", Sam (Ally Walker) convinces the VCTF to become involved in a series of murder/disappearances across the border in Mexico. A high-profile American businessman and the local authorities both have good reason to resent the VCTF's involvement and, as if that doesn't mean problems enough, Sam is commuting daily to Atlanta for the trial of her stalker, Jack. It's this latter storyline that provides the climactic ending when the trial takes an unexpected turn and Sam again finds herself at Jack's mercy, a twist that will have Profiler fans burning the midnight oil.
Round the Twist:
The Big Burp
(5pm Tuesday, Two)
 WITH a fourth series now being shot, series three of this fabulously successful Australian children's show begins in peak yukky form. The adventures of the Twist family, keepers of an old, haunted lighthouse, often revolve around all manner of bodily functions and this was never more obvious than in the opening episode. After relieving himself on a large tree, 14-year-old Pete meets a gorgeous tree spirit and, when they kiss, she informs him he is pregnant with their child. And if you think that is odd, wait until you see the birth scene. Who cares if it makes no sense? That's exactly why seven to 15-year-olds in 70 countries have made it one of our most popular TV exports.
 Water Rats: Obsession
(8.30pm Tuesday, Nine)
SOME emotive acting is a feature of this strong episode and the talk of the party at the recent season launch of Water Rats was the guest performance of Matthew Newton, son of Bert. He plays the devoted brother of a young woman found dead in the water after what was supposed to be a romantic sailing-camping weekend. Newton's character is still bitter and perhaps even slightly demented since the death of his mother in a car accident and he has transferred all his affection towards his older sister. Is it him, therefore, who blew up her new boyfriend's boat, accidentally killing her in the process, or could it be the boyfriend's former flame (Nadine Garner) jealous of a new rival? A well-constructed episode appeals on several levels and marks Newton as a new face to look out for.
