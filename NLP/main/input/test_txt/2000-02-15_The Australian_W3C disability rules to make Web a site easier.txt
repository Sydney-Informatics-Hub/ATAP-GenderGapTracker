ACCESSING the Internet is likely to become easier for people with disabilities following a decision by the Web's governing body to approve new guidelines for accessibility.
 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organisation responsible for developing online standards, last week approved the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), version one.
 The decision follows an earlier move by the W3C to introduce guidelines for people developing sites. These rules are designed to make sites accessible to people with sight disabilities.
Design flaws and the extensive use of tables, Java and animations can make it hard for blind people, who often use text-to-speech and braille devices to navigate the Web.
 Australia's Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) in March will deliver its report on overcoming barriers to disabled people accessing technology.
 The report covers the Web, as well as other online services, telephone IVR systems and ATMs.
 HREOC disability policy director David Moore said the W3C rules would make it simpler for Web designers to include components such as explanatory HTML tags and cascading style sheets.
 Such components made the use of text-to-speech devices easier, he said.
 "But that's not an excuse for not complying right away," he said.
 Mr Moore said HREOC was concentrating on compliance in government and major corporate Web sites.
 Financial institutions had been particularly co-operative, with most banking sites now working towards compliance with the W3C guidelines, he said.
 "With banking it's particularly important, because there are economic imperatives for customers going online," he said. "People who have difficulties can do a lot online."
 Ultimately, HREOC's big stick -- the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) -- may have to be wielded, Mr Moore said.
 "If you're in the business of providing services, you have to make them available to people with a disability," he said.
 But while the DDA provides such powers, lobbyists said voluntary co-operation should be encouraged.
 Royal Blind Society disability technology specialist Tim Noonan said corporates updating their Web sites to accommodate sight-impaired people would benefit by accessing a broader customer base.
 Those preparing simplified versions of their content also would be better equipped to tackle Wireless Applications Protocol (WAP) technology and the emerging Internet appliances market, he said.
 Accommodating people with disabilities would make sites more accessible to able-bodied people as well, he said.
 "A lot of people are very verbal, and people are going to want to listen to Web sites as well as look at them," he said.
 Mr Noonan said the W3C guidelines would make compliance easier, as many of the mundane tasks involved in increasing accessibility would be handled automatically by the development tools.
 "These tools should do things automatically to make the site more accessible, so the designers don't have to do all the work," he said.
