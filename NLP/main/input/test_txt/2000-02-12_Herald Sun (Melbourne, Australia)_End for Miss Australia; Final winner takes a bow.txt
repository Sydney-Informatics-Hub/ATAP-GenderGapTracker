WITH the flutter of eyelashes, the rich waft of perfume and the flick of lacquered hair, the Miss Australia Awards is bidding farewell.
 Teary faces will be well dabbed at tonight's selection of the last Miss Australia -- bringing to an end 46 years of an Australian icon.
 Miss Australia 2000 and Miss Australia Fundraiser 2000 will hold their titles for just 24 hours.
"A lot of women have expressed great sadness at the passing of this great institution," said Miss Australia Company chief executive officer Margaret Rohan Kelly, who held the 1967 title as Margaret Rohan.
 "It has been an Australian icon, as Australian as vegemite.
 "This was a very difficult and painful decision to make . . . but times have changed."
 From the post-war 1940s, when the phenomenon was born, to the bra-burning '70s and the business conscious '90s, Miss Australia has survived the pressures of time.
 Until now.
 Declining community interest, increasing costs and the need to keep abreast with modern-day female trends has sounded the death knell for Miss Australia.
 Organisers admit that its inability to shake
 the outdated image of a beauty quest has hindered efforts to stay relevant.
 The loss of the annual awards strikes a major blow to the spastic societies and cerebral palsy associations.
 Without this massive fundraiser, which has collected $90 million, these organisations will struggle to find funds.
 In 1947, when Judy Gainford was the first titleholder (there were no awards from 1948 to 1953), a woman was "seen to typify the radiant beauty and fresh outdoors life of our sunny land".
 Miss Australia evolved to become a major fundraiser and entrants benefited from personal training and development. Gone were the swimsuits and the crown. Gender bias was even given a stiff shake with the entrance of Victorian Brad Rogers, who became Miss Australia Fundraiser 1997.
 As described by Mrs Rohan Kelly, the awards educated people about disabilities and offered young women -- and some men -- a role model.
 "But Miss Australia is no longer unique in what it offers," she said.
 There are now countless organisations breaking down walls for the disabled and many role models in business, entertainment and sport.
 The 1973 titleholder Michelle Downs, (now Mrs Taylor), said changing times brought the demise of the awards.
 "Miss Australia (Awards) was like a gigantic interview for a public relations position," Mrs Taylor said.
 "I'd be silly to say looks didn't come into it . . . but beauty was not a criterion. She was a fundraising vehicle and promoted the needs of disabled people."
 Tonight's Miss Australia Awards, hosted by the Spastic Society, will be held at Crown.
