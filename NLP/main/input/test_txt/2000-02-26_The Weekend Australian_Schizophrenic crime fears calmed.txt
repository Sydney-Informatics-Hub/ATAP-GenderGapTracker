A STUDY prompted by police shootings of people with schizophrenia has found that allowing sufferers to live in the community does not increase the risk of their committing offences.
 The study found that despite a move towards deinstitutionalising mental health patients, with an emphasis on drug-assisted community care, there has not been a proportionate increase in crime.
Only a small number of people with schizophrenia commit crimes, but they have a higher rate of conviction for criminal offences compared with the general population.
 The study found people not suffering from schizophrenia were just as likely to commit sexual offences, and there was a problem of perception regarding schizophrenics living in the community.
 Researchers from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health and the Mental Health Research Institute compared conviction statistics from 1985 in Victoria with those in 1975 before major deinstitutionalisation.
 Philip Burgess, co-leader of the study, said while people with schizophrenia were 3.5 times more likely to get a criminal conviction, this accounted for a fraction of a per cent of sufferers.
 "What people forget is that people with schizophrenia are much more likely to take their own lives," Associate Professor Burgess said.
 He said the report, published in international medical journal The Lancet, made use of Vic-toria's computerised records on schizophrenic patients, which is the oldest in the world.
 Its release this week came as the Disability Council of NSW said, in its submission to a select committee inquiry into the state's increased prison population, that people with disabilities were disproportionately represented.
 Council chairman Leonie Manns said a 12th of the people in NSW prisons had intellectual disabilities although they were only 2 to 3 per cent of the population.
 "They are much more vulnerable (emotionally) and often subject to abuse by other prisoners," she said.
