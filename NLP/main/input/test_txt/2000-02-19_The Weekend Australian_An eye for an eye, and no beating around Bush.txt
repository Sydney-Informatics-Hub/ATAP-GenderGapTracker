Everything is bigger in George W.'s Texas, writes Damian Whitworth -- especially the queues for death row
A frail, grey-haired great-grandmother will be taken from her cell on Texas's death row next Thursday to a chamber where onlookers will see her strapped to a gurney and injected with lethal chemicals.
 Three days after her 63rd birthday, Betty Lou Beets looks likely to become the oldest inmate to be executed in Texas since the re-institution of the death penalty in 1976 and only the second woman. She will also be the 120th person to be executed on the watch of George W. Bush, the Texas Governor who has set a record pace in disposing of those incarcerated on death row. Mid election campaign, Bush finds himself assailed by the anti-death penalty lobby, which says he is in danger of presiding over an appalling miscarriage of justice.
Beets claims she was a battered wife. This comes as even advocates of the system are admitting there are flaws in the way the US executes its criminals, sending innocent people to their deaths. At her trial in 1985, Beets was portrayed as a black widow, a cold-blooded killer who had shot dead two husbands to claim their life insurance. It originally appeared that her fifth husband, Jimmy Beets, had drowned while out in his boat on a lake. Two years later, however, acting on a tip-off, investigators found the fireman's decomposing body in a sleeping bag buried near Beets's mobile home in Gun Barrel City. They also found the body of Beets's fourth husband, Doyle Wayne Barker, under the patio. Both men had gunshot wounds to the head and the jury did not take long to return a guilty verdict.
 But there is a more complicated version of the story. The jury rejected Beets's claim that her son, Robert Branson, had killed her husband during an argument and that she had helped bury the body because he was on probation. It also rejected the defence's insistence that there was no evidence that she fired the gun and they were not to know that Beets would subsequently not be tried with the murder of her fourth husband, whose death was used to show a pattern of spousal homicide. However, those fighting to save Beets's life say that the crucial factor is that the court was not told about her background.
 In a letter to Bush appealing for a stay of execution, Amnesty International and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence say that Beets is hearing-impaired and learning-disabled, that she was raised by a violent and alcoholic father and a mentally ill mother, and went through a succession of abusive marriages. She was married first at 15, became a mother a year later and was a grandmother at 30. All along the way, but particularly in the last two marriages, she was battered. Even if she killed them, the argument runs, she should be spared death because she had suffered provocation.
 In an interview on death row this week, Beets said she could not remember the killing, which she said happened after a quarrel while she was getting ready for her bath. "We started arguing, and after that I really don't remember much of what happened except that my son came in and [Jimmy] started in on him. And he had already gotten a gun." Juley Fulcher, of the national coalition, says: "Texas failed to protect Betty Lou Beets when she was being beaten by an abusive spouse. It will be a terrible miscarriage of justice if she is executed."
 Those clamouring for clemency have been joined by Sister Helen Prejean, whose nonfiction book about a man on death row, Dead Man Walking, was turned into a film. They point out that in five other states the sentences of battered women have been commuted.
 During the six years Bush has been Governor -- and his state has far exceeded any other in executing its prisoners -- just one sentence has been commuted: that of a man who was conclusively shown to have been in a different state when the crime of which he was convicted was committed.
 This week, President Bill Clinton said that governors should "look very closely" at their death-penalty systems to make sure that innocent people are not executed. This came after the decision of the right-wing Governor of Illinois to halt all executions in his state because 13 people scheduled to die had turned out to be innocent, including three who were exonerated after a student project showed other men were guilty. At least one innocent man died.
 Bush, however, said in this week's Republican debate that there was "no doubt in my mind that each person who has been executed in our state was guilty". And there was certainly no mercy when time ran out for Karla Faye Tucker, the only other woman to be executed in Texas in the past 25 years and one of three nationwide during that time.
 Like Bush, she was a born-again Christian, and religious leaders from Pope John Paul II to Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition appealed for mercy. In a notorious interview with Talk magazine Bush, the self-styled "compassionate conservative", was described as mimicking the woman as she begged for her life. "Please," Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, "don't kill me."
