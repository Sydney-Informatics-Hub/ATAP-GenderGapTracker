A DISABLED man says he is sickened by a "rotten" attack and robbery which left him in hospital with head injuries.
 The man, who has cerebral palsy, was repeatedly kicked in the head in the toilets at South Yarra train station on Wednesday afternoon.
The 41-year-old Hampton man spent the night at St Vincent's Hospital where he was treated for head injuries, cuts over the right eye and a blackened left eye.
 Sen-Det. Craig Pearson, of the transit CIU, said the man realised someone else was in the toilet when he went to wash his hands about 5.30pm.
 He was pushed to the ground and had his head stomped on at least eight times during a frenzied assault.
 "I'm absolutely astounded. It is gut-wrenching to think of the attack on this defenceless person," Sen-Det. Pearson said.
 Sen-Det. Pearson said the attacker stole the man's wallet from his pocket before escaping.
 It contained only a small amount of cash.
 "It is outrageous, the extent of injuries he has suffered, let alone the offence itself," Sen-Det. Pearson said.
 "He felt sick and it was rotten, (that) was the word he used."
 Police are looking for a man aged in his early 20s with brown hair.
 He was wearing a fawn-colored T-shirt with dark hoops, dark pants and a dark backpack.
 Anyone with information can call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
