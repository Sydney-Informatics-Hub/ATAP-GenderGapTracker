THE past may have been disappointing, but the future seems bright for technology entrepreneur and visionary Dennis Hayes.
 Rebuilding from the ashes of his collapsed company, the man who invented the modem is back and he is embracing the new dot.com culture.
 Beginning the 1990s as chairman of one of the best-known computer hardware companies in the world, Mr Hayes ended the decade on a sour note, out of his position, and with his old company struggling to survive under new management.
The pioneering modem vendor hit its first round of difficulties back in 1995, when it attempted to merge with competitor Boca Research before seeking protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.
 The company returned to the black in 1996, and went through a failed merger with Micronics before merging with Access Beyond at the end of 1997.
 That merger failed to support Hayes, which re-entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy under US law towards the end of 1998.
 Mr Hayes then resigned from the top job, in favour of Access Beyond chief executive Ron Howard. The new boss found bankruptcy was not enough protection for Hayes, which was liquidated in early 1999, closing down its operations when its bankers refused to back it further.
 "A lot of employees were very upset and distressed, and called me to say it was terrible that Hayes was liquidating," Mr Hayes said. "I told them to look back at what we had done and be proud."
 Seeing Mr Howard running Hayes, and witnessing the chaos that followed the company's eventual collapse was hard, he said.
 "As I left, it was like looking at a monster chomping on my childrens' arms and legs," he said. "But apart from that emotional turmoil it was okay.
 "I haven't looked back, because I'm looking forward and seeing very different opportunities."
 The future for Mr Hayes is looking brighter. He is chairman of the US Internet Industry Association (USIIA), and holds consulting roles with a number of Internet start-ups.
 Fascinated by the next wave of technology companies, the Hayes founder shares his experiences with the new generation of entrepreneurs.
 A veteran of political engagement, Mr Hayes lobbies for the USIIA on issues ranging from privacy to Net access for people with disabilities.
 The USIAA, which is linked with Australia's Internet Industry Association (IIA), represents major Internet access and content providers.
