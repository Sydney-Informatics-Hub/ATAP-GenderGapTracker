HAVE you ever been required to move house within a week or two? Try imagining it when you are unwell.
 Older people with serious illnesses can find themselves in a predicament in which they have to move from a hospital to a nursing home within a few days.
 Most commonly, this is after a stroke, fall or fracture, serious infection or heart attack.
It is not unusual for older people to be faced with this situation within a week or two of being quite well. But mostly the acute illness is the "straw that breaks the camel's back" in an already frail or disabled person.
 Because of high demand for hospital beds, decisions may need to be made quickly. This creates major concerns for older people. They will ask:
 IS it certain that there will be no recovery?
 WOULD I benefit from rehabilitation?
 WHERE is a good nursing home?
 HOW can I decide since I can't leave hospital?
 WHAT choice do I have?
 WHAT if I don't like the home?
 HOW much will I have to pay?
 WHAT will happen to my home and my belongings?
 Many people in this situation are confused because of dementia. The responsibility then falls to their families.
 This is a complicated problem that requires compassion and professionalism to resolve.
 It is not a simple matter of the hospital identifying a vacant nursing home bed and arranging the transfer.
 A successful process involves careful review of the situation by health professionals who understand the likelihood of recovery and the capacity of rehabilitation services to improve the patient's condition.
 An understanding of the ability of community services to offer an alternative is essential, as is assistance in selecting the nursing home.
 Fortunately, nursing homes have waiting lists that provide a moratorium to enable decisions to be made carefully.
 Hospital staff often find themselves confronted with a dilemma of suggesting the most popular nursing homes, knowing that these have the longest waiting lists.
 Usually, a choice of several homes will be necessary to ensure finding a place quickly.
 The transition to nursing home care is traumatic. The move is usually not the older person's preference.
 Staff at the nursing home are challenged with making the settling-in period as reassuring as possible. New routines are encountered, relationships must be established, and families made to feel welcome.
 Moving house is a challenge for all of us.
 We should recognise the considerably greater degree of difficulty for older people who are unwell. Health professionals should attend to this process with great care.
