A TEAM of disabled runners, two of whom are leg amputees, created history by winning a medal in the 4 x 100m relay against able-bodied sprinters at the national championships yesterday.
 Steve Wilson (NSW), Neil Fuller (SA), Tim Matthews (Vic) and Heath Francis (NSW)) combined to snatch the bronze medal as the third Australian team to finish in the final at Stadium Australia.
 The sensational result was helped by the disqualification of the New South Wales representative team from the Homebush Track Club.
But the Australian Paralympic squad had to break the world record for disabled teams to reach the final.
 "It's awesome for us. We were talking about how it would be awesome to win a medal in able-bodied competition and we've done it," said lead-off runner Wilson, whose right leg is amputated below the knee.
 Fuller, also a below-knee amputee, ran the second leg.
 "It's the first time a Paralympian has won a medal in any event at the nationals in athletics, as far as we know," he said.
 "We're so stoked. It puts us in a nice position. We ran 45.45sec to win the gold medal in the Paralympics in Atlanta four years ago and we clocked 43.39sec in our heat and 43.49sec in the final.
 "We're pretty confident we can take it into the 42sec area by October 19 when the Paralympics open in Sydney."
 The criteria for a disabled relay team is that at least two runners must be leg amputees. Matthews has lost his left arm and Francis his right arm.
 In another wonderful demonstration of triumph over adversity, Sydney's Amy Winters, 21, an arm amputee, carried the baton through the finish to win gold in the women's 4 x 100m for the NSW able-bodied team.
 "It's just amazing. I'm stoked. I think it's fantastic," she said. "A year ago I wouldn't have dreamed I'd be running here, but I qualified to enter the 100m on my own merits and now I'm going home with a gold medal."
 Sprint queen Melinda Gainsford-Taylor may steal the show from Matt Shirvington and Patrick Johnson when tonight's 100m titles are settled.
 Gainsford-Taylor gave a sneak preview in yesterday's 200m heats to suggest she is ready to break her 1994 national 100m record tonight.
 "She's in shape to do a national record. She could go very close to 11.0sec," coach Jackie Byrnes said last night.
 Gainsford-Taylor's national 100m record of 11.12sec was set at high altitude in Sestriere, Italy, in July 1994 and, despite missing all last season following bone surgery to her knee, she is a far more developed athlete now than six years ago.
 And the signs were there yesterday as Gainsford-Taylor floated to an easy 200m heat win in 23.52sec into a stiff 2.5m/sec headwind.
 FOR one it was just another day at the office, for the other it was the realisation of a childhood dream.
 Cathy Freeman did what she had to do in yesterday's 400m semi-final, winning comfortably, but it was what happened behind her that excited Australia's athletics hierarchy.
 In her first race against the world 400m champion, Sydney schoolgirl Jana Pittman showed she has a big future.
 While Freeman coasted to the line in 53.17sec, nearly five seconds outside her personal best, Pittman, 17, was only a couple of strides behind her, clocking 53.25sec.
 Patrick Dwyer was the fastest qualifier for the men's 400m final running 46.64sec in yet another impressive display from the talented AIS runner.
