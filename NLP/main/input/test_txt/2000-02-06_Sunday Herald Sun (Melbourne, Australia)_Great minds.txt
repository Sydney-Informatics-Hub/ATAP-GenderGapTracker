Hermann Helmholtz
 German physicist 1821-1894

Gregor Johann Mendel
 Austrian botanist 1822-1884
 Created the science of genetics. Studied science at university then returned to life as a monk after graduating. Fascinated by how characteristics in humans, animals and plants are passed down through generations, he began experimenting with pea plants in the monastery gardens. Mendel discovered what we now call the genes that determine such things as plant height and flower color, but fame came only after his death.
Louis Pasteur
 French chemist and biologistÂ  1822-1895
 Pasteur was a biologist, but he was also a Frenchman, with a certain interest in making wine last longer once it was bottled. What turned it sour, he discovered, was bacteria in the alcohol; when he destroyed the bacteria with heat, voila! the wine kept its taste. This "pasteurisation" process was then applied to milk. He proved that disease is caused by micro-organisms, and was the first to develop vaccines for rabies and anthrax.

 Alfred Nobel
 Swedish chemist 1833-1896
 Hardly a good start: five people were killed when his explosives factory blew up. Nobel defied an official ban on working with explosives and began experimenting in secret.

 Scottish inventor 1840-1921
 A veterinary surgeon who had a bright idea while mending his child's tricycle wheels: he bound air-filled rubber hoses to the wheels instead of solid rubber tyres. So successful was the idea that he formed a company in 1899 manufacturing pneumatic bicycle tyres. Making air-filled car tyres was the logical progression -- but his Dunlop Rubber Company was the first to do it.
Robert Koch
 German physician 1843-1910
 Developed techniques for isolating and testing bacteria and for cultivating and studying their growth. His systems became the basis of modern bacteriology.
 Thomas Barnardo
 Irish philanthropist 1845-1905
 Planned to go to China as a missionary but changed his mind and stayed in London's East End to teach and help poor families instead. He raised money to provide homeless children with a place to sleep and train them in trades: during his lifetime more than 50,000 children were sheltered and trained in Barnardo homes. Today the charity finds foster homes for children, helps with adoption and supports families of children with disabilities.

began producing the Brownie camera in 1900 then, after amassing fabulous wealth, gave half it away to charities and cultural institutions.
Nikola Tesla
 US physicist 1856-1943
 Described as the forgotten genius of electricity, Croatian-born Tesla devised the electric light, domestic electricity supplies, radio, fluorescent light, seismology, a worldwide data communication network and a mechanical laxative -- and gained none of the credit. Perpetually unlucky and dogged by an appalling business sense, Tesla's ideas were usually nabbed by other inventors who gained the fame.
Emmeline Pankhurst
 English suffragette 1857-1928
 The British campaign to give women the right to vote began not with Emmeline but her husband, Richard, a radical lawyer who supported women's rights and introduced the first women's suffrage bill in Britain.

 Henry Ford
 US engineer 1863-1947
 Transformed American society by making cars accessible and affordable. Established the Ford Motor Company in 1903 to build cars of his own design.
