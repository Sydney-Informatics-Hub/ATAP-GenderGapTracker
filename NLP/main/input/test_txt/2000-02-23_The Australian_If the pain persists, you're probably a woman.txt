The discovery that the sexes feel pain differently is giving scientists a few headaches. Nigel Hawkes reports

WOMEN not only feel pain slightly more than men but almost certainly do so in a distinctly different way. The discovery by a team at the University of Illinois raises the possibility of "his and hers" painkillers, formulated to work for the different brain chemistry of the two sexes.
 Jeffrey Mogil told the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington on Monday that it has been known for some time that women have a slightly lower pain threshold then men, though the difference, he says, is not great.

More surprising is the evidence found so far only in mice and rats that pain perception in men and women is qualitatively as well as quantitatively different.
 "Both feel pain, but they are responding differently, by activating different circuitry in the brain," Mogil says.
 The main difference he has found is in a set of receptors in the brain called the NMDA receptors for n-methyl d-aspartate. These receptors are clearly involved in the reception of pain signals in male mice because, if they are blocked by using a compound called MK801 (originally developed as a possible drug by Merck Sharp and Dohme), then male mice become insensitive to painkillers. But female mice do not. This clearly indicates that the females are not using the same pathway but must have a different one, so far unidentified.
 The finding also applies to rats and probably to human beings as well. But explaining why the sexes should have evolved different pain perception systems is not easy.
 "Here's one speculation," Mogil says. "We did a lot of our evolving as hunter-gatherers. There was a separation of tasks in hunter-gathering societies: men hunted, women gathered. One might imagine there might be more adaptive pressure on males to evolve a strategy to kill the pain of trauma -- lion bites and spear points.
 "Females might have been less exposed to those types of pain, and more exposed to other types of pain: visceral pain involved in childbirth, for example. So there might have been subtly different selective pressures, such that the best analgesic mechanism in men would have different properties than the best in women."
 The argument also applies to rodents, in a modified form. Males are more likely to fight among themselves, so evolving a means of bearing the pain of injury would be more important to them than to females.
 Mogil's work with inbred strains of mice has shown huge differences in their response to pain. Some strains can barely tolerate any degree of it, while others do not seem to mind at all.
 He says that this probably applies equally to humans, and should make us pause before mocking those who whine about pain.
 "There really are differences in our response to pain," he says.
 The great differences also raise hopes that if the genes that control them can be identified, much more effective painkillers could be developed.
 Mogil envisages the day when people going into the operating theatre will have a blood test to identify their genetic response to pain, allowing the optimum strategy for post-operative pain relief.
 It might even be possible to help those who are disabled by pain sensitivity, where even stroking their skin is agonising. Gene therapy could deliver a "better, more advantageous form of a gene" to an affected area to reduce or eliminate chronic pain.
 The experiments on mice are done by putting them on a hotplate and watching how long it takes them to pick up a paw and shake it. The pain is mild and does them no harm.
