BARBRA Streisand's concerts at Colonial Stadium are likely to be moved to Optus Oval or the MCG if union work bans continue to jeopardise the venue's opening date.
 And the AFL plans to switch its opening round matches at Colonial to the MCG or Waverley if the ground is not ready.
 The stadium's builder renewed warnings yesterday that crippling bans on seat installation and laying of turf would delay its opening date of March 2.
"If the bans remain, the stadium will not be completed and that's going to cost Victoria tens of millions," Baulderstone Hornibrook director Hedley Davis said.
 A spokeswoman for Streisand promoter Kevin Jacobsen said Optus Oval would probably host the March 15 and 17 concerts, if needed.
 Earlier, Mr Jacobsen said from Los Angeles that he would consider the MCG for the concerts that will be the singer's swansong.
 The AFL games under threat are Essendon vs Port Adelaide on March 9 and St Kilda v. Sydney on March 12.
 But the MCG is scheduled to host three first-round matches and the AFL may be unwilling to increase pressure on its surface.
 The AFL would decide in early March whether to move the games, spokesman Patrick Keane said.
 Colonial Stadium general manager Martin Mowlam has tried to play down Baulderstone Hornibrook's gloomy predictions.
 He has assured home teams Essendon and St Kilda and the concert promoters the stadium will be ready for their events.
 But Mr Davis said it would be impossible to open the ground without a pitch and work on laying turf was delayed by bans.
 The bans are in support of building unions' push for a 36-hour week and an 18 per cent pay rise.
 Although union pressure has seen working hours cut at Colonial, the bans are still in place because contractors have not given CFMEU members their desired 6 per cent a year pay rise.
 CFMEU state secretary Martin Kingham said bans would only be lifted when every sub-contractor at the site agreed to the union's claims.
 Mr Kingham said one-fifth of sub-contractors at the site had agreed to an interim deal.
