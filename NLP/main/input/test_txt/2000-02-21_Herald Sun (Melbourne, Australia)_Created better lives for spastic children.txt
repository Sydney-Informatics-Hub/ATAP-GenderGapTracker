LAURENCE ALBERT RATTRY-WOOD
Spastic Society president
 Born: November 14, 1902
 Died: January 17, 2000
 LAURIE Rattray-Wood's interests and achievements were as diverse and fascinating as the 20th century in which he mostly lived.
 But it was his work as president of the Spastic Society of Victoria that gave him most fulfilment and satisfaction.
 He oversaw the establishment of seven institutions for the disabled across Melbourne and was the recipient of many honors.
He was also a foundation member of the Harley-Davidson Motor Cycle Club of Victoria, a keen sportsman and dance-band leader.
 Laurence Albert Rattray-Wood was born in Melbourne in 1902, the eldest of four children. He was educated at Fitzroy Grammar School, North Fitzroy Elementary School and the Working Men's College (now RMIT).
 His first job was cutting out ties at Henry Bucks, before becoming an engineer at firms in Burnley and Coburg.
 In 1933 he was a major in the Citizen Military Forces, but was annoyed to discover his engineering profession was classified as a "reserved occupation" in World War II.
 As a young man he was a talented cricketer, footballer and a competent violinist, taking a keen interest in the great violinists.
 He was also an enthusiastic dance band leader, a pursuit that brought him much-needed work during the Depression.
 His other interests included Freemasonry and breeding budgerigars.
 His motorcycling interests one day led him on a tour to Lakes Entrance where he met the love of his life, Jess Hamilton, who was holidaying there at the time. They married in 1932.
 Throughout their life the couple devoted time to many charitable causes, particularly the Spastic Society of Victoria.
 Their second child, Elizabeth Anne, was born with cerebral palsy, a twist of fate that would help the lives of thousands of Victorian children suffering from the condition.
 Mr Rattray-Wood was a respected and self-effacing man and became the Spastic Society's president after its establishment in 1948.
 "In those early days, all we could do was to publicise that there was an organisation to look after children and endeavor to get support," Mr Rattray-Wood once said.
 He was instrumental in establishing the Marathon School in Malvern Rd, Toorak, where children with severe and multiple disabilities could receive quality therapy and education.
 Mr Rattray-Wood later oversaw the opening of five day-centres and two residential facilities for the care of disabled Victorians.
 In later years, he became the Spastic Society's patron and president of the Australian Cerebral Palsy Association.
 He was awarded an MBE in 1973 and the Queen Elizabeth silver jubilee medal in 1977.
 "The Spastic Society of Victoria salutes the determination and dedication with which Laurie Rattray-Wood offered his unique leadership and vision," said SSOV spokeswoman Siobhan O'Neill.
 "He established the highest standard of services and increased opportunities for Victorians with disabilities to reach their full potential."
 Mr Rattray-Wood is survived by his son Laurie Jr, three grand-daughters and seven great-grandchildren.
