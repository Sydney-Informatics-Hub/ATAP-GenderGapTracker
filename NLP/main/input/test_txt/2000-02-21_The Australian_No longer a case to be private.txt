Catholic school funding needs a shake-up, for Christ's sake, argues Michael Furtado
..
LAST week's article on religious education in Australian schools (Schools, February 14), did not examine one pressing question. That is, whether Catholic schools should continue to be funded as part of the independent private school sector.
 My doctoral research argues for the strengthening of the principle of education as a public good in Australia by relocating Catholic systemic schools into a deregulated, diversified public education sector.
 As the situation stands, many students from disadvantaged social groups can't afford to attend Catholic systemic schools. Such an economic reality clashes with Catholic teaching and philosophy, for example, on justice for Aborigines and accessing the social goods of this world for those who need them most.
Catholic schools are under pressure to become the cheap alternative private schools in the Australian educational market. In some regions of Australia, up to 70 per cent of their clientele claim no formal allegiance to the Catholic faith, while government schools serve more than 50 per cent of Catholic children.
 Although the poor may not be any more Catholic, the deregulated funding environment makes it less possible for the church to offer its educational services to those who cannot afford fee for service because entry to a Catholic school will be mediated more than ever on its capacity to raise a proportion of its own funds.
 Historically, the Catholic systems have absorbed inevitable losses in some systemic schools and colleges -- due to unpaid fees and local incapacity to raise funds -- by drawing from a basket of services that equitably distributes block public funding according to needs-based formulas.
 In recent times, one of the growth industries surrounding the Catholic systems has been debt collection. Up to one-quarter of Catholic schools, particularly in lower socioeconomic areas, must remind parents about the necessity for fees to be paid in full and on time.
 Many government schools raise funds for local use quite effectively, and are able to enhance school community resources that poorer government and non-government schools would have no hope of affording without Commonwealth help. In such instances, the resort to a form of means-testing in determining Commonwealth funding to all schools, government as well as non-government, may well be a reasonable if not an ethical thing.
 ONCE the principle of means-testing becomes a factor in differentiating funding for government schools, it is more than likely that the Catholic systems would see great sense in bringing their schools into a deregulated but accountable public sector where they could more easily cater for those who would otherwise lack the means to access their schools. Several Catholic agencies, such as hospitals, already fall into this public sector category.
 The deregulated government school environment would enable Catholic systemic education to provide places for children who, especially in country Australia, simply do not make it in representative enough numbers to Catholic schools, particularly lower socioeconomic, Aboriginal and disabled children.
 Finally, a deregulated public school system would be one that honours a far more socially just principle, such as that of the common good, rather than one that automatically and somewhat uncritically associates everything that is free, secular and compulsory with what is educationally desirable to parents.
 Government schools, including Catholic ones, as in New Zealand, the UK and several parts of North America and Europe, would be able to demonstrate a variety and a degree of accountability that would reverse the residualising trend for public education many people justifiably fear. Catholic systemic schools would become accountable for precisely those exclusions that run counter to their vision and intention.
 Catholic systemic schools, motivated undoubtedly by the Catholic Church's teaching that the Catholic school is not for the privileged and therefore cannot be regarded as a private school in class terms, will respond well to any invitation to improve Australian public education by becoming part of its diversified provision, provided they are guaranteed no loss of their schools' special character.
 Where are the people of goodwill on both sides to agree?
