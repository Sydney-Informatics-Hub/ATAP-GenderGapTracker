No need for
prisoners
ADRIAN Jackson (Herald Sun, February 16) recommends that we somehow capture all the young people who partied happily and peacefully at the St Kilda Festival and send them to Puckapunyal for compulsory national service.
 His comments criticising the St Kilda Festival are wrong.
 Indeed, reports in the Herald Sun and most other news outlets on how fantastic, diverse and family oriented the festival was, is evidence of its huge success.
 Four hundred thousand people spent the day listening to a variety of music on seven stages and engaging in beach-related sport and activities.
I saw no aggro or violence. I witnessed only celebration.
 Port Phillip Council is not aware of any police reports from the day.
 Police told me the event was friendly and without drink-induced drama. The liberal use of non-alcohol areas meant that those who wanted could escape the demon drink entirely.

Duck shelter
costs plenty
TO Mark Little (Herald Sun, February 17) -- all RSPCA supporters know that the organisation has had an anti-duck shooting policy for years.
 Why then are you withdrawing your financial support because they are now speaking up about it?
 Having had experience as a volunteer in an RSPCA wildlife shelter, any financial donation you may have given would have had to have been a substantial one to go anywhere near meeting the cost of the wildlife shelter operations during duck season.
 That is, housing, feeding and
 patching up the injuries to ducks and other wildlife. Liz Duggan,

Long wait
for Viet vets
NOTING the speed of the response by Mr Howard and his Cabinet to the demise of National Textiles, I congratulate the government for their quick decision to ensure that National Textile workers received their entitlements.
 Contrast the speed of Cabinet's National Textile decision with the government's response to the report they released more than three months ago on the health of Vietnam veterans and their children.
 This report confirmed that a number of debilitating medical conditions afflicting veterans and their dependants were significantly higher than for the rest of the community.
 The government promised veterans' organisations they would amend the Repatriation Act to cover these severely disabled young victims of war.
 The response from the office of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs last November was: "Any assistance for these children must be done within the constraints of the next Budget to be formulated in May 2000".
 It is outrageous that severely disabled children of Vietnam veterans, some of whom are now in their early 30s, have to wait for another three months to be considered for any assistance, particularly with Mr Costello now declaring he will pursue a "firm" and "rigorous" stance in the May Budget.
 For Mr Howard and his government to continue to ignore this major tragedy, while at the same time responding very quickly to the National Textiles issue, is deplorable and will disadvantage many in the Vietnam veteran community. Alan Ashmore,

Tackled on
Storm comment
IT IS indeed unfortunate that Arnold Jago (Herald Sun, February 19) does not avail himself of all the facts when commenting on a very sensitive matter.
 Yes, the Storm did call in a chaplain to assist the team, but the reason was not because of the team's performance on the rugby pitch, but to assist in the grief surrounding the loss of football manager Michael Moore.
 Before one spouts off, one needs to get the facts right. Take your foot out of your mouth and do the right thing and apologise.

Footy plan
favors Vics
I'M A fan of John Elliott's divisional idea for the AFL (Herald Sun, February 18) with one exception -- dividing teams along state lines. Without going through all the maths, it appears that the Victorian teams get off lightly when it comes to travel.
 With Victorian clubs playing at least 14 games in Melbourne, I'm guessing most of the Div. 1 v. Div. 2 matches would need to be played outside Victoria to get an equitable system.
 If not, come finals time, your interstate player is likely to be somewhat wearier than their Victorian counterpart.
 John Elliott was also reported as saying "America's national competitions were still based
 on geography and traditional rivalries".
 That's true to a point, but excluding situations such as the Los Angeles and New York derbies in the NBA and NFL respectively, most away matches involve getting on a plane. The last time I looked, AFL teams do not own luxury jets for transporting their players.

Job offer
attracts illegals
THE suggestion to employ illegal immigrants for the fruit-picking industry would be the most stupid political decision of the century.
 It would definitely encourage more and more people to come illegally to this country.
 On one hand, this will be tantamount to a kind of slavery in a just society, and on the other hand it will legalise entry.
 We are supposed to have an unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent. If fruit-pickers were offered reasonable wages, there would not be a shortage of pickers.
