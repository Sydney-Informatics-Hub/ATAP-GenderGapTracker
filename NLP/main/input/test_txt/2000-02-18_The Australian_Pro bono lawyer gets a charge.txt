MICHELLE Hannon is a lawyer paid to work for free.
 A full-time pro bono lawyer ("pro bono publico" -- for the public good) with Sydney law firm Gilbert & Tobin, Ms Hannon says she and her colleagues find the work satisfying because of its human and social dimensions.
 "We do work for nothing for people who are basically in marginalised and disadvantaged groups," she says.
Typical clients who fall through the cracks of reduced government legal aid and community legal centres include Aborigines, children and the disabled.
 "Our view is that lawyers are in a very privileged position," Ms Hannon says.
 "They have access to how the legal system works. It's naive to think people can defend or represent themselves on any sort of equal footing without legal representation."
 In 1998-99, she had 154 pro bono cases open, many of them anti-discrimination actions, but she has to turn away many requests for help. Even so, a victory in a public interest test case can have a big social impact.
 The work is good for her firm's morale, Ms Hannon says, and the pro bono program is one reason why good lawyers want to join the firm.
 The Australian Law Reform Commission in its report yesterday said it was important to encourage pro bono work and "the legal professional ideal" at a time when lawyers were often seen "in less charitable lights".
 In 52 per cent of cases, lawyers funded privately worked up to a quarter of the time without charging, the commission found.
 And in 25 per cent of cases, legally aided lawyers spent between a quarter and half their time without charging.
 Private firms doing family law work under a tightened legal aid regime in effect paid a subsidy of at least $17.5 million in 1998-99, according to a National Legal Aid survey.
