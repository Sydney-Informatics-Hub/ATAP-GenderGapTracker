MANCHESTER United sprinted six points clear at the top of the English Premier League yesterday while former England manager Glenn Hoddle made a winning debut with Southampton.
 Striker Andy Cole scored twice, the first a breathtaking chip and the second from a David Beckham cross, while Paul Scholes grabbed a third as European champion United beat Coventry City 3-2 at Old Trafford.
 The Red Devils' main title rivals, Leeds and Arsenal, were both beaten away from home, with Leeds losing 3-1 at Liverpool and Arsenal suffering a shock 2-1 defeat at lowly Bradford City after going a goal down in the 10th minute.

That loss inflicts a mortal wound on Arsenal's title ambitions, leaving the Gunners nine points adrift of United, having played one match more.
 Hoddle, dismissed by England a year ago this week amid a furore over his comments about disabled people, returned to the Premier League with a 2-1 win against West Ham at The Dell.
 West Ham's Gary Charles ensured Hoddle's winning start with an own goal four minutes from time.
 "It's pleasing to have a win, that's the most important thing," Hoddle said. "There is a buzz here. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
 Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson praised Cole's marvellous play, but was unhappy with his team's performance against Coventry.
 "We were careless at times and Coventry worked very, very hard," he said. "Maybe they can consider themselves a bit unfortunate.
 "I felt that making the one or two changes that we did, maybe the players were a bit rusty. You take some risks and make variations and sometimes have to pay the price for it."
 United left Dwight Yorke and Ryan Giggs on the bench, starting with Cole and Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer up front.
 Leeds manager David O'Leary said Manchester United was clearly the best team in the country, but he refused to give up his hopes of giving it a run for its money.
 "I think today they (Leeds) know they can play better," O'Leary said. "But we can't lose sight that we're still second in the league. There's 15 games left."
 Liverpool scored all three of its goals from outside the penalty area, the first a 20th-minute free kick by Dietmar Hamann that appeared to take a deflection off Leeds defender Jonathan Woodgate.
 Lee Bowyer equalised with a diving header in the 62nd minute, but Liverpool went ahead again seven minutes later when Patrik Berger thumped in a booming 28m shot. Danny Murphy hit the third on the final whistle.
 Bradford's Dean Windass began Arsenal's nightmare by floating a free kick around the wall to beat David Seaman, busy organising his defensive wall, for his 100th league goal.
 French star Thierry Henry replied three minutes later from long range, but Bradford's Dean Saunders brought the home side three crucial points by beating Seaman one-on-one, rolling the ball under the England keeper.
 Newcastle United and Sunderland shared the spoils in Bobby Robson's first Tyneside derby as Magpies manager. The sides drew 2-2 after the Premier League's top scorer, Kevin Phillips, had hauled Sunderland back from 2-0 down with two goals.
 Phillips has 21 goals ahead of Cole on 15.
 Sheffield Wednesday, second from bottom, gave up a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3 with Derby County in a thriller at Pride Park, while Aston Villa thumped bottom side Watford 4-0, the Hornets' fourth successive defeat.
 Middlesbrough dropped into the bottom six, losing 2-1 at Leicester City.
