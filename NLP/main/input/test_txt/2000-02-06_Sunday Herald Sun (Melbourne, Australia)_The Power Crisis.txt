AFTER a weekend reprieve, power restrictions return tomorrow with Victorians being warned to follow the rules or face tough penalties.
Power distributor VENcorp has taken a full-page advertisement in today's Sunday Herald Sun detailing the restrictions that apply between 1pm and 7pm tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday.
 Households can not use air-conditioners, clothes dryers, dishwashers, computers, video recorders and electronic music equipment between those hours.
 Businesses have also been ordered to switch off air-conditioners, as well as reducing the use of lights, lifts and television and video equipment.
 Exemptions apply for the elderly, disabled, babies and children, and those with terminal illness or other chronic conditions.
