BARELY two months after she closed the books on her university degree, Ana Carrondo is back in the classroom.
 The rookie school teacher has just embarked on a huge life lesson -- her debut in the full-time workforce.
 Carrondo, 26, last week joined the excited throngs starting a new chapter in state schools.
 A wide-eyed group of Grade 4 pupils will soak in her words of wisdom over the coming year.
"I was so nervous on my first day," the Meadow Heights Primary School recruit confesses.
 "I spent the holidays having nightmares about whether the children would like me.
 "Being a teacher is a big responsibility. These kids are taking in everything you say and look up to you as a mentor."
 Her young charges will tackle reading, writing, arithmetic, social skills, water safety and drug education as part of their learning feast in 2000.
 Carrondo, who was inspired to be a teacher after a stint as a nanny, hopes to strike a fine balance between friend and teacher.
 "It is important to develop a relationship with your students, to have them see you as human," she says.
 The pressure to be super-organised will be one of her biggest challenges.
 "Four years of university can never fully prepare you for what is ahead, and how to deal with a room full of children without creating chaos."
 Carrondo, one of hundreds of new teaching graduates hired this year, says many people outside the education system underrate the dedication that is needed.
 "I have been in by 8am most mornings and have been leaving at 6pm most nights," she says.
 "Then there is the work you take home, such as corrections and preparation."
 Carrondo believes proper planning, assessment and constant professional development are keys to successful teaching.
 Colleague Jo Howard, 41, agrees wholeheartedly.
 The Grade 5 teacher and information technology co-ordinator has seen major changes since she first set foot in front of the blackboard in 1980.
 Howard's career has included teaching disabled and special education children, Preps, and Grades 1, 2 and 5.
Howard says staff today face stricter performance scrutiny and more record-keeping demands.
 Computers and the Internet are also having a dramatic impact on lesson structure and access to resources.
 "My laptop computer has been nicknamed my second husband," Howard says.
 Her IT expertise evolved in a support role.
 She worked with a technician to help install hardware, order software and show classes how to use tools such as e-mail.
 Despite the invasion of the information superhighway, basic qualities such as patience, creativity, time management, communication skills, compassion and above all, a love of children, remain crucial.
 "The most enjoyable part of teaching is finding out children's interests and seeing them grow and blossom," Howard says.
 As a Level 2 teacher, she is in charge of a group of Grade 5 teachers.
 Her week is split into 19 hours of class contact time, and administrative and IT
 duties.
 Starting salary for new Victorian state school teachers is $35,665. Income ranges up to $49,159 for teachers, $55,848 for leading teachers, and $98,216 for principals.
 These salaries are due to rise 2 per cent in July. Salary packaging of benefits is also available.
 The State Government has pledged to lift teacher morale, status, job security and career opportunities through measures including:
 A NEW Victorian Institute of Teaching, a professional body designed to raise teaching standards.
 MOVING from contract to permanent positions.
 LIFTING a legal gag that banned teachers from making public comments about policy.
 COMMITTING $64 million over four years for professional development in learning technologies.
 Two-hundred-and-fifty annual scholarships will also be issued to attract the best Bachelor of Education graduates.
 Job prospects are predicted to improve over the next two decades as older teachers move out of the workforce. The average age of teaching staff in Victorian state schools is now 43.
