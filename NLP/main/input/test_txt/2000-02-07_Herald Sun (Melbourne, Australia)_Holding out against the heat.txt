hot  spots
HEALTH authorities expect thousands of workers to go home when air-conditioners grind to a halt this afternoon.
 Employers are bracing for a productivity slump during the power bans, which run from 1 to 7pm.
 Medical experts are warning employees to be careful of dehydration as the mercury rises, especially in offices with sealed windows.
People working through this afternoon's power restrictions are urged to drink plenty of fluids and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothes.
 Most offices across Melbourne are expected to relax strict dress codes to cope with the heat.
 Sapped energy, poor concentration and dizziness are among the warning signs of dehydration.
 Australian Medical Association state president Michael Sedgley said workers needed to take precautions if they were working in hot conditions.
 Pregnant women needed to take particular care if they were standing up for long periods.
 Psychologists expect the higher temperatures to cause friction at work as tempers flare.
 Australian Psychological Society spokesman Les Posen said heat was often linked to aggressive behavior. "There is potential for people to let fly a bit more in these conditions," he said.
 "Frustration levels rise and concentration drops when it's hot. Employers will have to think about rostering people off.
 "Smart employers will turn it into a positive, making it a team-building exercise. There should be some sort of reward for effort in difficult circumstances."
 Monash University psychology expert Max Jory believes the restrictions will create a strong sense of community in workplaces.
 Dr Jory says Victorians have had enough time to prepare for the shutdown of air-conditioning.
 "People won't be comfortable in the heat, but I don't think frustration will be a problem," he said.
 "People know that they're not alone . . . It was the same during the gas crisis . . . a real sense of community spirit."
 Melbourne University psychologist Erica Frydenberg agreed: "Crises like these bring out a real sense of camaraderie. People know that they're all in this together."
 Chief health officer Graham Rouch said people who were elderly, disabled or chronically ill were exempt from the bans.
 Dr Rouch said families with newborn babies also escaped the bans, also in place from 1 to 7pm tomorrow and Wednesday.
 Hospitals, nursing homes, residential care facilities, pre-schools, kindergartens and day-care centres for the aged were also exempt, he said.
 Doctors, dentists and other health services such as pathology centres would be permitted to cool medical, clinical and diagnostic equipment, but not themselves or their customers.
