NATIONAL Textiles workers will be paid $11 million in entitlements by the middle of next month after the administrator of the failed company hammered out a deal with major secured creditors yesterday.
 But the deal, which guarantees payment to the 312 sacked workers and secured creditors, leaves 400 unsecured creditors facing a payout of about 2c in the dollar on the more than $12 million they are owed.
 Among the unsecured creditors is Mai-Wel, a Hunter Valley sheltered workshop, whose disabled clients are owed more than $5000 for mowing lawns until the last week before National Textiles closed its doors on January 19.
The collapse of National Textiles, which was chaired by John Howard's brother Stan, left many local businesses facing substantial losses, with one plumber being owed $30,000.
 Administrator John E. Star said yesterday: "Unsecured creditors have been told from day one that any distribution to them would only be nominal.
 "The payout will be between 1c and 2c and 5c in the dollar, but I'd say it will be closer to the lower threshold than the higher threshhold."
 The Prime Minister's backing for a special payment plan for the National Textiles workers is expected to provide the ammunition for a full-scale assault by Labor on John Howard's integrity when federal parliament resumes tomorrow.
 The Opposition will pursue the issue of why other workers sacked without entitlements, such as at Braybrook in Victoria, cannot be regarded as a special case like the National Textiles workforce.
 The deal is a major turnaround from an earlier proposal that would have made Philip Bart, who has a 40 per cent stake in National Textiles, the first creditor to have his loan to the company repaid. Mr Bart will contribute $3 million to pay sacked workers and lower the claim of the major secured lender, Scottish Pacific Finance.
 The plight of small creditors such as Mai-Wel generated anger on the National Textiles picket line last night.
 "The Mai-Wel crowd are a dead-set group of champions and they (National Textiles) are rotten mongrels for what they've done to them," said textile worker David Brown.
 "Mai-Wel had a bloke with one arm washing cars and people with cerebral palsy going around with whipper snippers. Why should they be getting ripped off?"
 Mr Star's deal will be put to a creditors meeting in Newcastle next week for final ratification.
 It will contain special clauses to ensure the workers receive their money within 30 days.
 The deal also involves a complex refloating of National Textiles, which will continue to operate its Australian Weaving Mills subsidiary in Devonport, Tasmania.
 Mr Star said AWM, which employs 270 people, was being assisted by a $2.5 million loan guarantee from the Tasmanian Government. Negotiations for further financial help from the Tasmanian Government were ongoing.
 A spokesman for Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon said AWM had always been regarded as a "good employer".
 Mr Star's deal will also see about $1 million in rebates due to National Textiles by major customers repaid to the Scottish Pacific finance group.
 Scottish Pacific had rejected a previous settlement offer partly because the rebates would have gone to Mr Bart's Oldtex Pty Ltd, National Textiles's major shareholder.
 Mr Star said Oldtex would have to "stand back and get its money over a period of time".
 "It will be a long time before Oldtex sees its money back," Mr Star said.
