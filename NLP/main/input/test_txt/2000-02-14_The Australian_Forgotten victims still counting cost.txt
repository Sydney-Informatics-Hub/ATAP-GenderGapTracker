PLUMBER John Phillips is likely to get just $600 of the $30,000 National Textiles owed him before it was put into administration.
 He feels the company's creditors have been forgotten.
"Where's the support for us from the Government?" he asked. "$600 is nothing. We'll have to increase the overdraft."
 Mr Phillips said he still had to pay for his workers and materials, despite not being paid for the emergency repairs he did on the factory in the NSW Hunter Valley in the month before it shut down.
 The plumber is just one of many unsecured creditors who administrator John E. Starr said yesterday would get about 2c in the dollar.
 Mai-Wel, a group that provides supported employment and residential services for people with disabilities, is owed more than $5000 by National Textiles.
 Mai-Wel chairman Bob Manson said the charity was owed for mowing done between August and January and could expect to receive up to $250.
 'We are only one of the creditors, but it is unfortunate when boardroom tactics impact on charities and people with disabilities," Mr Manson said.
 A fortnight before National Textiles shut down, welder Bill Drain was contracted to fix broken tanks. He will get $60 of the $3000 he is owed.
 "John Howard could drive past and not even see me," he said. "But I'm no different to any employee."
