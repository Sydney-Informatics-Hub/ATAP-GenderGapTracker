AUSTRALIAN sport has known many champions: Don Bradman, Roy Cazaly, Betty Cuthbert, Walter Lindrum and more. Scores of names known even to those with little interest in sport.
But only occasionally has a person who followed a sport become as famous as those they watched.
 Stephen Harold Gascoigne was one. This rabbitoh from the Sydney suburb of Balmain, who was better known as Yabba, became a legend in cricket through his theatrical performances on the Sydney Cricket Ground Hill.
 Laurie Nichols achieved a similar status in rugby league. It was perhaps befitting that Balmain was involved, too -- in Nichols's case, his beloved Balmain Tigers.
 Nichols's performances in the grandstands of the Tigers' home ground, Leichhardt Oval, and at other rugby league arenas in Australia and overseas were every bit as theatrical as those of Yabba.
 He was instantly recognisable -- dressed in a singlet even when the temperatures dropped well below zero.
 It was a throwback to his early days as a shearer on the Monaro. Shearers have always worn singlets, Jackie Howe singlets, named after the gun shearer of the 1890s who set records never to be matched until electric shears and wide combs made the backbreaking work just a little less taxing.
 Nichols would shadow-box in his singlet at the front of the grandstands, and shout rhymes about the Balmain club and the stars who helped make it famous.
 "Black and gold will never fold!"
 "Garry Jack, the world's greatest back!"
 "Peter Jones crushes bones!"
 Of Paul Sironen, who played more first-grade games than any other Tiger in history: "Sirro, he's a hero!"
 Corny? Maybe. But they came straight from the heart.
 Nichols's sideline performances and his simple rhymes belied the fact that he was an intelligent and caring man.
 And he was fond of a joke. There is the story of the time he was in the US, barracking for world boxing champion Kostya Tszyu, whom he supported with the same fervour he showed for the Tigers.
 A bystander at the gym where Tszyu was training was intrigued by Nichols and asked if he had appeared in the movie Crocodile Dundee.
 "No, but I train kangaroos to work as couriers -- they can get to places cars can't," Nichols replied.
 "Goddamn! Do you mean you ride 'em?" asked the incredulous American.
 "Ride them? How do you think we get around during petrol strikes?"
 Lawrence James Nichols, one of 13 children, began his working life as a sheep shearer around his home town of Cooma. (He later moved to Springwood in the Blue Mountains, then to The Entrance on the NSW central coast.) His roots as a shearer led to a career as a well-respected wool-classer.
 The involvement with Balmain began in the early 1960s when he went to Sydney looking for a club for Syd Williams, the brother of his best mate, who was playing junior football in Springwood.
 Williams joined Balmain on the field -- and so did Nichols off it.
 The young Williams was to become part of Tigers folklore by scoring the only try of the 1969 grand final, when Balmain caused an upset by beating the fine South Sydney combination that had won the premiership the previous two seasons.
 A little-known side of Nichols was his tireless work for charity.
 Radio broadcaster and former Balmain coach Alan Jones once told him: "Laurie, you can't save the world."
 The ultimate Tigers fan replied: "Maybe, but you can always do something."
 That something was the Laurie Nichols Trust Fund for the handicapped and disadvantaged.
 Nichols was at a charity dinner at a Sydney restaurant eight days ago, helping raise money for a young disabled girl, when he had a coughing fit. An ambulance rushed him unconscious to hospital, where he died.
 Nichols gave an emotional speech at Balmain's extraordinary general meeting last year, arguing against the proposed merger with Western Suburbs.
 His pleas fell on deaf ears and he swore he would never watch another game of rugby league.
 "This merger will dead-set kill me," he told friends.
 But only a day before his death, Nichols was at a training session of the merged Wests Tigers.
 "I couldn't desert my boys," he explained.
 Nichols is survived by his daughter, Julie, and grandchildren Melissa, Luke and Courtney.
