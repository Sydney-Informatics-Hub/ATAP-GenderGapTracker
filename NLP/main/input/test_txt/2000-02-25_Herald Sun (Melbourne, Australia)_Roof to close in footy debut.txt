COLONIAL Stadium's roof will be closed for the first AFL game at the ground on March 9.
 The decision means Essendon and Port Adelaide will make history by staging the first indoor AFL match for premiership points.
 The AFL has decided
to shut the roof because of doubts over its automated closing mechanism.
The league does not want to risk a downpour ruining the newly-laid turf during the game.
 The $460 million stadium roof can be closed manually, but it takes at least 30 minutes and cannot be done with a crowd in the arena.
 AFL operations manager Ian Collins said the fault with the automated roof mechanism would rule out a half-time closure in the event of rain.
 "It is being closed by another mechanism and it's preferable that that's done when there's no one in the stadium," he said.
 The March 9 clash will be the first indoor game played for premiership points as well as the first under a roof in Australia. The stadium management has admitted some disabled fans could be forced to miss the game because of work bans on lifts.
 People with physical disabilities seated on level one should have few problems, but fans in higher tiers will face a steep climb up ramps.
 Builder Baulderstone Hornibrook has arranged discussions between the Electrical Trades Union and Kone Elevators to resolve the dispute and get the lifts running. The company's southern
region director, Hedley Davis, said even if the bans came off it would
be two weeks before all lifts and escalators were operating.
 "My expectation is that bans will be lifted in the stadium but it's by no means certain," he said.
 Baulderstone hopes to have the roof fixed within two weeks and predicts all food outlets will be open for the first match.
 Though the ground has no air-conditioning, it is designed to provide enough air flow to keep temperatures down even on hot days.
 In another industrial blow yesterday, 30 metalworkers downed tools at Colonial over AFL chief Wayne Jackson's criticisms of construction
delays.
 It was also revealed yesterday that East Timor missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in Australian aid because the plumbing union refused to forgo free football tickets.
 Workers at Colonial Stadium have been offered $140,000 of free tickets to AFL matches at the ground.
 Members of three of the four unions on site voted to donate most of the cost of the 10,000 tickets to building a technical school for East Timorese children.
 The arrangement fell through because the plumbers did not agree.
 The head of the plumb ing section of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, Tony Murphy, said its members had earned the tickets.
