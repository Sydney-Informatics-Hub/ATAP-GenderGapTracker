how to cope
 HEALTH authorities say employers should consider sending sweltering office staff home.
 Human Services Department acute care chief Chris Brooke also recommends relaxed dress codes for the next working week.
 He fears modern offices with sealed windows may become pressure cookers without air-conditioning. Tall buildings with restricted lift access are also a concern for the senior bureaucrat.
Dr Brooke urges Victorians to adhere to power bans, leaving restricted electricity supplies to those who need it most.
 He says household power bans will not be enforced on the elderly, frail, disabled, acutely ill or women with newborn babies.
 Hospitals, nursing homes and aged care hostels are also exempt.
 Details of the restrictions came yesterday as dozens of overheated Melburnians sought help from hospital emergency departments.
 Hundreds sought medical help the day before.
 Heart failure, fainting attacks and dehydration were among the heat-related illnesses treated in emergency rooms across the city.
 Several fit young tradesmen also needed emergency care for heat exhaustion. Doctors warn people working outside to maintain a high fluid intake.
 Lower temperatures today and tomorrow should offer some relief, but doctors expect to be swamped next week as the mercury climbs again.
 Afternoon bans on air-conditioning, lighting, computer use and lift access will create even more problems, according to Dr Brooke.
 He urged employers and staff to use "plain common sense" during the crisis.
 "This is a significant occupational health and safety issue," he told the Herald Sun last night.
 "People in office buildings without air-conditioning should certainly wear cooler clothes next week. And employers need to look at whether people need to be in the buildings.
 "From a health point of view . . . it's the responsibility of the employer to look at options."
 Dr Brooke said bans were designed to make sure power was supplied to the people in most need. Elderly and disabled people should not be worried about using power during the bans.
 "So long as they are genuine, there is no need for them to be concerned about anything," Dr Brooke said.
 "It's not like the gas crisis, where there was no gas . . . in this case we have electricity, but we need to make sure that the people who need it get it."
