A MAN who admitted strangling a grandmother and dumping her body in a bath is fighting a murder charge on the basis he did not mean to kill her.
 The body of Judith Fowler, 54, of Narre Warren, was found in the half-filled bath by her daughter on December 7, 1998, a Supreme Court jury heard yesterday.
 The jury was told Craig John Whittle, 36, had admitted to police he strangled her on December 2, 1998, and dumped her body in the bath when he thought she was dead.
"I just started to get aggro . . . I grabbed her and started choking her," Mr Whittle told police in a section of an interview read to the court.
 "She was on the bed. I started squeezing (her neck). It was an accident . . . I didn't mean it. I'm sorry this happened."
 Mr Whittle has pleaded not guilty to one charge of murder.
 In his opening speech, prosecutor Paul Coghlan, QC, said even though Mr Whittle, formerly of Frederick St, Dandenong, thought Mrs Fowler was dead when he put her in the bath, he punched her in the face so hard he broke her nose.
 Mr Coghlan said Mr Whittle told police he had assaulted Mrs Fowler, his former landlady, because she told another man earlier that night that he had taken a can of alcoholic drink from her fridge.
 Mr Coghlan said Mr Whittle was intellectually disabled, but his actions that night showed he was capable of murder.
 In opening the defence case, Mr Whittle's lawyer, David Drake, told the jury Mrs Fowler may have died from an asthmatic attack or a massive overdose of sleeping pills rather than as a result of Mr Whittle strangling her.
 Mr Drake said Mrs Fowler was found with 4 1/2 times the normal prescribed amount of Mogadon in her body.
 He said she could have drowned in the bath and, if this was the case, it cast doubt on the claim Mr Whittle had intended to kill her.
 "At the time of putting her in the bath, was he intending to kill her or was he incapable of intending to kill her because he thought she was already dead?" Mr Drake asked the jury.
 He said it was clear Mrs Fowler died for want of air but that did not mean his client's strangling of her caused her death, pointing out that she had been a chronic asthmatic and a heavy smoker.
 The trial before Justice Bernard Teague is due to continue today.
