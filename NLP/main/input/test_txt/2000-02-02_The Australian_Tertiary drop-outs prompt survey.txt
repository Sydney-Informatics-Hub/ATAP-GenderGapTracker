UNIVERSITIES understand some of the reasons students drop out -- but a new project should help them better focus on how to keep students at their studies.
 Alienation, especially at the elite universities, has been pinpointed by research as one of the main reasons for students dropping out.
 The study will look at how institutions monitor attrition and wastage, and identify factors that contribute to students dropping out in their first year.
Louise Watson, of Canberra University, Richard Teese and John Polesel of the University of Melbourne, and Barry Golding of the Bendigo Regional Institute of TAFE won $40,000 for the project under the Government's Higher Education Innovation Program.
 Dr Watson, a research fellow in the education faculty's Lifelong Learning Network, said the 12-month study, which includes TAFE, would go further than other research on attrition.
 The aim was to try to get universities to collect data so they could identify the types of students at risk and then use that data to influence their policies.
 "What studies have shown is that some universities and some courses have good retention rates and others have appalling retention rates," she said.
 "So it seems very much a problem that can be addressed at an institutional level, if the motivation's there. And that's what we're aiming to highlight."
 Dr Watson said the sector had a "fair idea" why students dropped out, with alienation being one of the main reasons.
 She said those feelings of alienation were more likely to occur in elite institutions.
 Special effort was needed to support students through practices such as pastoral care and orientation.
 She said US research showed that universities could make a difference in retaining students. They just needed to focus on the issue.
 "Maybe you need policy instruments to give them the right incentives to focus on it."
 A 1998 Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs study estimated that, nationally, four out of every five students are retained in higher education institutions each year.
 But crude retention rates vary significantly from 97 per cent at Marcus Oldham in Victoria to 49per cent at Batchelor in the Northern Territory.
 They also differ markedly for different groups of undergraduates. For example, women are more likely than men to complete their course.
 An Edith Cowan University study found that first-year students at higher risk of attrition were those from isolated areas, Aborigines, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, those with disabilities, commencing non-school-leavers in undergraduate courses, students in courses lower than a bachelor pass, external students and students enrolled in masters by research.
 As well as looking at the data collected by universities and TAFEs and how institutions use it, the latest study will look at the social background of students and the three main types of factors associated with non-completion -- personal, course-related and institutional.
