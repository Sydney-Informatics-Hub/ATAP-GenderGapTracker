THE State Government is offering financial incentives to the private operators of the public transport system to persuade them to build some of their rolling stock locally.
 Transport Minister Peter Batchelor said thousands of jobs would be lost if the operators -- National Express, Melbourne Transport Enterprises and MetroLink -- moved production of trains and trams offshore.
He said the move would destroy Victoria's rolling stock manufacturing industry.
 When the private companies took control of public transport last August, Melburnians were promised 60 new trains and 90 hi-tech trams accessible to the disabled as part of a $1.6 billion injection into the state's transport infrastructure.
 Mr Batchelor said the former Kennett government did not stipulate any local-content requirement in its final franchise agreements with the private firms.
 "The work can be done absolutely anywhere and that is a huge problem for Victoria's manufacturing industry," Mr Batchelor said.
 He said National Express was looking to France and Germany to build its trains and trams, while Melbourne Transport Enterprises (which runs Hillside Trains) and MetroLink (Yarra Trams) had chosen European train builder Alstom as their preferred supplier.
 Mr Batchelor would not reveal what financial incentives the government was offering.
 "We are talking about investments worth a very substantial amount of money, so obviously we are using the full resources of the government to do what we can," he said.
 Mr Batchelor criticised the previous government for allowing production to move offshore.
 "We have insisted our trains and trams be made here to keep our manufacturing industry going," he said.
 In December, representatives of more than 60 companies and employees involved in the rolling stock industry met to protest against the operators' actions.
