FAR too often obituaries in farming newspapers include the phrase "as the result of a farm accident".
 Farming is Australia's second-most dangerous occupation. While accidents in the most dangerous occupation, mining, grab headlines because of their catastrophic nature and the numbers involved, farm accidents have been stealthily claiming the lives not only of farm workers, but also of farm children.
 In 1998 the reported farm death toll was 52, but the real toll is believed to be three times that number. Worksafe Australia estimates the cost of work-related injury and illness in the agricultural sector is up to $1.29 billion annually.
The Farmsafe Australia story began in 1988, after the first national farm safety conference.
 "At that stage, we had no idea about the magnitude of the problem. We just had this feeling that things weren't right," Lyn Fragar said.
 At their first farm safety promotion, in the northern NSW town of Moree, hearing screening tests were conducted on local farmers.
 "A good number of farmers came in and 60 per cent of them had a really disabling level of industrial deafness," Dr Fragar said. It was one of the first pieces in putting together the risks and damage that make the big picture of farm health and safety.
 Farmsafe's first priorities were reducing tractor deaths, machinery deaths and child deaths.
 In 1998, 20 of the 52 farm deaths were a result of tractor accidents.
 A campaign in Victoria to fit tractors with roll-over protective structures (ROPS) has shown the way. From 1985 to 1994 there was an average 4.3 deaths a year in Victoria due to tractor rollovers. Since 1995, when the project began, that figure has fallen to one.
 There is growing pressure on NSW and Queensland, which both experience up to 12 tractor rollover deaths a year, to follow the Victorian lead.
 Executive director of Farmsafe Queensland, Jamie Cupples, said: "It is the smaller old tractors that seem to be the killers. It doesn't happen in the big broadacre farming area; they are not using that sort of equipment.
 "The other issue with tractors is people riding on the mudguards, or hanging on the back of them, and falling off the tractor. All we can do about that is education.
 "The other big issue we are concerned with is in the animal handling area -- we have horse injuries, motor bike injuries. A lot of those accidents end up with spinal injuries; they are quite severe and totally incapacitating."
 One response has been to teach natural horsemanship, a horse whisperer type of approach, which already has reduced accident rates.
 And there has been a cultural change.
 "The head stockman who puts the new ringer on a rough horse and he's thrown off on his first morning, which is what they used to do, would be sacked straight up nowadays," said Mr Cupples.
 Children are particularly at risk from drowning, which is responsible for 45 per cent of all child farm deaths, and engulfment in silos, as well as from vehicle and horse accidents. "We have several education programs for children," Mr Cupples said.
 Last year, Farmsafe Australia decided to examine and address agricultural aircraft deaths, firearm deaths, horse-related deaths and vehicle deaths.
 Farmsafe Australia last year began running the Managing Farm Safety training program. Dr Fragar said about 1300 farmers had done it so far. "We are just starting to see an exponential increase in farmers doing it".
 Farmers are now well aware of the dangers on the farm. Dr Fragar said the program takes them from "being worried" to having "the knowledge and skills and the on-farm management tools, like industry-related check lists, that will allow them to properly manage health and safety risks on their farms".
