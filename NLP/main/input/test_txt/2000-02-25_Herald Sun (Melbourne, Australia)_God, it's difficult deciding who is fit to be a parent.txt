MUCH as I'm often critical of the incumbent, if the position of God ever becomes vacant, I won't be applying.
 Consider the difficult decision of who should be allowed to become parents.
 Whoever is running this show we call life, it's obvious that many good people are not being blessed with children, while countless sundry fools are failing to count them as a blessing.
In America some judges are getting to play God in deciding parental fitness to a degree unknown in Australia.
 This week, Montana District Judge Dorothy McCarter ordered 29-year-old Dawn Marie Sprinkle not to get pregnant for 10 years.
 Sprinkle has been banned from future motherhood because she's a junkie. In 1998 she gave birth to a son who was found to have amphetamines in his system.
 J UDGE McCarter claims she didn't want "another damaged baby born because we didn't do enough to supervise that woman".
 So every two months for the next decade, the law requires Sprinkle to undergo pregnancy testing. If she tests positive, she'll be jailed.
 It's an extraordinary judgment, not least for its apparent unbridled confidence in contraception.
 Denying someone the right to breed strikes at the very heart of individual liberty. It is more than a little ironic that the American constitution includes the right to bear firearms, but not children.
 Of course, we do sanction judges and welfare workers to play God to a lesser extent here. It's a lousy job but someone has to do it.
 As we are all too painfully aware, a 19-month-old baby died this week after being left in a car in a heatwave.
 The mother, 39, is alleged to have been gambling in an air-conditioned pub.
 The mother has been charged with manslaughter and our courts are now responsible for her fate.
 A fact the courts will have to consider is that the woman has another, younger baby.
 Determining the future of this mother and baby will require the wisdom of Solomon and few could envy those with such responsibility.
 Society throws up wildly divergent views on what constitutes acceptable parents.
 Who would forget the remarkable case seven years ago when Victoria's welfare authorities raided the so-called Children of God sect and subsequently had to give control back to the parents?
 In that case, the law found the children were of a lesser God when under state control.
 One area screaming out for attention now is the need to clamp down on those who unlawfully play God by abetting widespread sterilisation of disabled girls.
 The law requires parents to obtain Family Court authorisation before a child can undergo any medical procedure such as sterilisation, which could permanently affect quality of life.
 But that isn't stopping thousands of parents and doctors unlawfully denying disabled girls all opportunity of motherhood.
 A HUMAN Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report reveals that while only 17 sterilisations of girls have been authorised by courts and tribunals since 1992, a staggering 1045 girls have been unlawfully sterilised since that time.
 As the Family Court's Chief Justice, Alastair Nicholson, has said, the unauthorised sterilisation of minors is a criminal assault.
 He views this abominable practice as a "liability timebomb waiting to explode".
 What is shocking is that so little is being done to stop it. Health Minister Dr Michael Wooldridge simply needs to authorise the handing over of Medicare records to investigators and action can be taken against offending doctors.
 That would begin to teach them that the job of God is not theirs for the taking.
