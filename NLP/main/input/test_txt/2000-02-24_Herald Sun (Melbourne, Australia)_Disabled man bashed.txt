DETECTIVES are hunting a ruthless thug who viciously attacked a disabled man in the toilets of a suburban railway station.
 The 41-year-old Hampton man was repeatedly kicked in the head before his wallet was stolen in the sickening assault at South Yarra yesterday afternoon.
The victim spent the night at St Vincent's Hospital where he was treated for head injuries, cuts over the right eye and a blackened left eye.
 Transit detectives were hoping to interview him and review security footage this morning.
 Police said the man was followed into the toilets at the station about 5.30pm.
 He was pushed to the ground and kicked in the head seven or eight times before his attacker fled with his wallet, containing only a small amount of cash.
 Police are looking for a thinly-built man described as about 20 years old with long, wavy blond hair and an ear ring in his left ear.
 He was wearing white jeans, a white t-shirt and a beige jumper.
 Anyone with information can call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
