Like any eight-year-old, Noel Spurr loved going to parties. He also loved football, so a party at his parents' Forest Hill home for the local Vermont football team was something to look forward to.
 Noel remembers feeling unwell when the big night finally arrived. It could have been the excitement, it could have been flu, but he put on a brave face and his best clothes and was there to greet his heroes.
As the night wore on, Noel became seriously ill and was put to bed with what was thought to have been the Asian flu.
 A week later, he was no better. When he complained that he was unable to move, he was taken to Fairfield Hospital and was diagnosed with polio.
 That was in 1956, the year of the last major polio epidemic in Australia and Noel Spurr was to spend the next 18 months in hospital.
 "I had type 3 polio which meant I was paralysed all over," Mr Spurr said this week.
 He vividly remembers that first night in hospital, when he stopped breathing.
 "It was one of the most frightening nights of my life," he said. "I had to be put into a respirator, an iron lung.
 "I was terrified because I thought I must be dead -- it looked like a coffin."
 Mr Spurr was to spend almost two years in that iron lung because the polio, caused by a viral infection in the brain and spinal cord, had paralysed his diaphragm, making it impossible for him to breathe on his own.
 "I hated being in an iron lung," he said. "(But) it did teach me not to worry about the little things, not to waste my time or energy on things that were not important.
 "I also made up my mind not to let polio beat me, that I was not going to be a spectator in life."
 His spirited approach to life was no doubt inherited from his parents, Norm and Laurie.
 Mrs Laurie Spurr was determined her son would come home as often as possible. Every weekend she took him home to Forest Hill -- by tram.
 "I was in what was known as a double Thomas splint, which meant I was bandaged from head to toe, totally unable to move," Mr Spurr said.
 "Undeterred, my mother would somehow get me on a tram to take me home."
 Mrs Spurr soon realised the tram ride was not the most suitable way to transport her son, so she started a catering business to raise money for a car.
 That same determination meant her son was soon back in school, at Yooralla, and a year later he was walking with calipers.
 Mr Spurr completed his education at Yooralla and admitted that by 22 he was burning the candle at both ends.
 "I was trying to do too much and I had a relapse," he said. "I ended up with respiratory failure and that put me back in an iron lung. This time forever."
 Mr Spurr said that by 1989 portable ventilators were introduced to Victoria and he was one of the first to receive one.
 He still uses a portable ventilator and says it does not restrict his life too much.
 Now married to Margaret, who also developed polio as a child, with two children, Richard, 21, and Elizabeth, 19, Mr Spurr is a councillor for the City of Whitehorse and is active in groups that campaign on behalf of disabled people.
 In 1983 he was given an Advance Australia Award and in 1985 an Order of Australia for his work with disabled people.
 He said he becomes angry when people do not vaccinate their children against the deadly polio virus.
 "I know there are risks with vaccinations," he said. "But that is rare compared with what polio could do if it was ever allowed to return to the community."
