Republican lawmakers and previous administration officials had begged Trump to give a statement to his supporters to quell the violence. He posted his video as authorities struggled to take control of a chaotic situation at the Capitol that led to the evacuation of lawmakers and the death of at least one person.

Trump has harnessed social media — especially Twitter — as a potent tool for spreading misinformation about the election. Wednesday's riot only increased calls to ban Trump from the platform.

"The President has promoted sedition and incited violence," said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, in a statement. "More than anything, what is happening right now at the Capitol is a direct result of the fear and disinformation that has been spewed consistently from the Oval Office."

In a statement Thursday morning, Trump said there would be an "orderly transition on January 20th" and acknowledged defeat in the election for the first time. His aides posted the statement on Twitter because his account remained suspended.
