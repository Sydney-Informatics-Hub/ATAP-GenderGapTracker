f0561fba445a1043dbc9c489fa9a37b2,"2000-02-25_Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)_God, it's difficult deciding who is fit to be a parent","MUCH as I'm often critical of the incumbent, if the position of God ever becomes vacant, I won't be applying.
 Consider the difficult decision of who should be allowed to become parents.
 Whoever is running this show we call life, it's obvious that many good people are not being blessed with children, while countless sundry fools are failing to count them as a blessing.
In America some judges are getting to play God in deciding parental fitness to a degree unknown in Australia.
 This week, Montana District Judge Dorothy McCarter ordered 29-year-old Dawn Marie Sprinkle not to get pregnant for 10 years.
 Sprinkle has been banned from future motherhood because she's a junkie. In 1998 she gave birth to a son who was found to have amphetamines in his system.
 J UDGE McCarter claims she didn't want ""another damaged baby born because we didn't do enough to supervise that woman"".
 So every two months for the next decade, the law requires Sprinkle to undergo pregnancy testing. If she tests positive, she'll be jailed.
 It's an extraordinary judgment, not least for its apparent unbridled confidence in contraception.
 Denying someone the right to breed strikes at the very heart of individual liberty. It is more than a little ironic that the American constitution includes the right to bear firearms, but not children.
 Of course, we do sanction judges and welfare workers to play God to a lesser extent here. It's a lousy job but someone has to do it.
 As we are all too painfully aware, a 19-month-old baby died this week after being left in a car in a heatwave.
 The mother, 39, is alleged to have been gambling in an air-conditioned pub.
 The mother has been charged with manslaughter and our courts are now responsible for her fate.
 A fact the courts will have to consider is that the woman has another, younger baby.
 Determining the future of this mother and baby will require the wisdom of Solomon and few could envy those with such responsibility.
 Society throws up wildly divergent views on what constitutes acceptable parents.
 Who would forget the remarkable case seven years ago when Victoria's welfare authorities raided the so-called Children of God sect and subsequently had to give control back to the parents?
 In that case, the law found the children were of a lesser God when under state control.
 One area screaming out for attention now is the need to clamp down on those who unlawfully play God by abetting widespread sterilisation of disabled girls.
 The law requires parents to obtain Family Court authorisation before a child can undergo any medical procedure such as sterilisation, which could permanently affect quality of life.
 But that isn't stopping thousands of parents and doctors unlawfully denying disabled girls all opportunity of motherhood.
 A HUMAN Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report reveals that while only 17 sterilisations of girls have been authorised by courts and tribunals since 1992, a staggering 1045 girls have been unlawfully sterilised since that time.
 As the Family Court's Chief Justice, Alastair Nicholson, has said, the unauthorised sterilisation of minors is a criminal assault.
 He views this abominable practice as a ""liability timebomb waiting to explode"".
 What is shocking is that so little is being done to stop it. Health Minister Dr Michael Wooldridge simply needs to authorise the handing over of Medicare records to investigators and action can be taken against offending doctors.
 That would begin to teach them that the job of God is not theirs for the taking.

d4ee3b2fa184f8d55fd3ee616468f1dd,"2000-02-25_Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)_Robber kicks palsy victim","A DISABLED man says he is sickened by a ""rotten"" attack and robbery which left him in hospital with head injuries.
 The man, who has cerebral palsy, was repeatedly kicked in the head in the toilets at South Yarra train station on Wednesday afternoon.
The 41-year-old Hampton man spent the night at St Vincent's Hospital where he was treated for head injuries, cuts over the right eye and a blackened left eye.
 Sen-Det. Craig Pearson, of the transit CIU, said the man realised someone else was in the toilet when he went to wash his hands about 5.30pm.
 He was pushed to the ground and had his head stomped on at least eight times during a frenzied assault.
 ""I'm absolutely astounded. It is gut-wrenching to think of the attack on this defenceless person,"" Sen-Det. Pearson said.
 Sen-Det. Pearson said the attacker stole the man's wallet from his pocket before escaping.
 It contained only a small amount of cash.
 ""It is outrageous, the extent of injuries he has suffered, let alone the offence itself,"" Sen-Det. Pearson said.
 ""He felt sick and it was rotten, (that) was the word he used.""
 Police are looking for a man aged in his early 20s with brown hair.
 He was wearing a fawn-colored T-shirt with dark hoops, dark pants and a dark backpack.

de1e9d81a1f6b7a3caddd915e49735af,"2000-02-25_Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)_Roof to close in footy debut","COLONIAL Stadium's roof will be closed for the first AFL game at the ground on March 9.
 The decision means Essendon and Port Adelaide will make history by staging the first indoor AFL match for premiership points.
 The AFL has decided
to shut the roof because of doubts over its automated closing mechanism.
The league does not want to risk a downpour ruining the newly-laid turf during the game.
 The $460 million stadium roof can be closed manually, but it takes at least 30 minutes and cannot be done with a crowd in the arena.
 AFL operations manager Ian Collins said the fault with the automated roof mechanism would rule out a half-time closure in the event of rain.
 ""It is being closed by another mechanism and it's preferable that that's done when there's no one in the stadium,"" he said.
 The March 9 clash will be the first indoor game played for premiership points as well as the first under a roof in Australia. The stadium management has admitted some disabled fans could be forced to miss the game because of work bans on lifts.
 People with physical disabilities seated on level one should have few problems, but fans in higher tiers will face a steep climb up ramps.
 Builder Baulderstone Hornibrook has arranged discussions between the Electrical Trades Union and Kone Elevators to resolve the dispute and get the lifts running. The company's southern
region director, Hedley Davis, said even if the bans came off it would
be two weeks before all lifts and escalators were operating.
 ""My expectation is that bans will be lifted in the stadium but it's by no means certain,"" he said.
 Baulderstone hopes to have the roof fixed within two weeks and predicts all food outlets will be open for the first match.
 Though the ground has no air-conditioning, it is designed to provide enough air flow to keep temperatures down even on hot days.
 In another industrial blow yesterday, 30 metalworkers downed tools at Colonial over AFL chief Wayne Jackson's criticisms of construction
delays.
 It was also revealed yesterday that East Timor missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in Australian aid because the plumbing union refused to forgo free football tickets.
 Workers at Colonial Stadium have been offered $140,000 of free tickets to AFL matches at the ground.
 Members of three of the four unions on site voted to donate most of the cost of the 10,000 tickets to building a technical school for East Timorese children.
 The arrangement fell through because the plumbers did not agree.
 The head of the plumb ing section of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, Tony Murphy, said its members had earned the tickets.

1f96367cf21a9270f798657996b60646,"2000-02-26_Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)_Law, order, motherhood all in a day's work","GABY Tomkin is perhaps best described as an organised achiever.
 A successful property lawyer and mother of two pre-school children, Gaby has branched out into the competitive world of residential home construction with some amazing results in the past three years.
 It is not surprising considering Gaby, 36, is the daughter of Alex Tomkin, the managing director of prominent Victorian company Tomkin Homes.
 But although Gaby has moved into home construction, she is not part of a well established family business.
""I like to be independent,"" she said. ""I suppose I have inherited a few ideas about home building from my father such as his slow and conservative approach.
 ""I also have followed his advice on never over-committing on borrowings and sticking to what you know about the business.
 ""You have to be so careful. I spent 10 years as a property lawyer cleaning up other people's mistakes.""
 It was Gaby's legal work that took her to Dallas, Texas, 10 years ago and a plum job in the then US Secretary of State James Baker's law firm.
 Her husband John had been transferred to Dallas and Gaby did not want to be without him for two years, so she followed.
 ""I was the first foreign lawyer to be paid. There were more than 1000 lawyers working in the firm. I sat my bar examination and have my US qualifications,"" she said.
 Part of her salary package in cluded a free psychiatric visit each week, an offer she did not take up.
 But after two years she became homesick for Melbourne.
 ""We had our honeymoon on the way back to Australia and then we got married on our return,"" she says.
 Four years ago, about the time she was pregnant with eldest daughter Lauren, husband John set up his own legal firm, Fetter Gdanski, with Gaby as a consultant.
 After Lauren's birth, she worked two days a week but she quickly found it was impossible to do legal work part-time.
 She turned her attention to renovating John's old bachelor pad in Elwood and found she enjoyed the work.
 They then bought a block of land in Brighton on which her father built their home -- and the introduction to home construction began.
 ""We have moved seven times in six years,"" Gaby said.
 Among her achievements to date have been the completion of six townhouses in Hampton, six in Brunswick and four in Moonee Ponds.
 And while these projects were growing, Gaby also found time to give birth to their second daughter Nicole, now 2.
 But it is the latest project at 194 Alma Rd, East St Kilda, which is Gaby's pride and joy.
 The 24 apartments, half of which have already been sold off the plan by agent John Kaufman of Wilson Pride, Caulfield, will be finished by June 30. They are priced from $197,000
 ""Don't worry, that's the deadline and they will be finished,"" Gaby said confidently.
 And how does this, attractive mother-of-two cope with the building site hard hats?
 Very well, it seems.
 ""They are all pussycats. Being a woman is a definite advantage. It's important to use what you've got in business,"" she said.
 Daughter Nicole is sometimes the wild card in the equation.
 ""I take her on site and after about an hour she gets restless so everyone knows the time constraints,"" Gaby said.
 Gaby also likes to vary house design to suit the local area.
 For instance, the Hampton townhouses will have a ""beachy"" look -- part rendered, part brick.
 ""I like lots of light and space. Homes should be usable and multi-functional,"" she adds.
 But large-scale property developers need not worry -- Gaby is not planning a take-over.
 ""These 24 townhouses in Alma Rd are the biggest single project I want to tackle. If I have to delegate responsibility to others I feel I can't rely on them. I need to be in control,"" she said.
 ""Anyway, I'd miss out too much on playing with my kids,"" says Gaby, who still finds time to do work for ACCESS, a charity which helps disabled children return to school.
 For further details on the 24-unit development at 194 Alma Rd, St Kilda East, contact Wilson Pride on 9500 1111.

4d6fcdb05211d4a26b55890d79361929,"2000-02-26_Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)_Shock bronze in relay","A TEAM of disabled runners, two of whom are leg amputees, created history by winning a medal in the 4 x 100m relay against able-bodied sprinters at the national championships yesterday.
 Steve Wilson (NSW), Neil Fuller (SA), Tim Matthews (Vic) and Heath Francis (NSW)) combined to snatch the bronze medal as the third Australian team to finish in the final at Stadium Australia.
 The sensational result was helped by the disqualification of the New South Wales representative team from the Homebush Track Club.
But the Australian Paralympic squad had to break the world record for disabled teams to reach the final.
 ""It's awesome for us. We were talking about how it would be awesome to win a medal in able-bodied competition and we've done it,"" said lead-off runner Wilson, whose right leg is amputated below the knee.
 Fuller, also a below-knee amputee, ran the second leg.
 ""It's the first time a Paralympian has won a medal in any event at the nationals in athletics, as far as we know,"" he said.
 ""We're so stoked. It puts us in a nice position. We ran 45.45sec to win the gold medal in the Paralympics in Atlanta four years ago and we clocked 43.39sec in our heat and 43.49sec in the final.
 ""We're pretty confident we can take it into the 42sec area by October 19 when the Paralympics open in Sydney.""
 The criteria for a disabled relay team is that at least two runners must be leg amputees. Matthews has lost his left arm and Francis his right arm.
 In another wonderful demonstration of triumph over adversity, Sydney's Amy Winters, 21, an arm amputee, carried the baton through the finish to win gold in the women's 4 x 100m for the NSW able-bodied team.
 ""It's just amazing. I'm stoked. I think it's fantastic,"" she said. ""A year ago I wouldn't have dreamed I'd be running here, but I qualified to enter the 100m on my own merits and now I'm going home with a gold medal.""
 Sprint queen Melinda Gainsford-Taylor may steal the show from Matt Shirvington and Patrick Johnson when tonight's 100m titles are settled.
 Gainsford-Taylor gave a sneak preview in yesterday's 200m heats to suggest she is ready to break her 1994 national 100m record tonight.
 ""She's in shape to do a national record. She could go very close to 11.0sec,"" coach Jackie Byrnes said last night.
 Gainsford-Taylor's national 100m record of 11.12sec was set at high altitude in Sestriere, Italy, in July 1994 and, despite missing all last season following bone surgery to her knee, she is a far more developed athlete now than six years ago.
 And the signs were there yesterday as Gainsford-Taylor floated to an easy 200m heat win in 23.52sec into a stiff 2.5m/sec headwind.
 FOR one it was just another day at the office, for the other it was the realisation of a childhood dream.
 Cathy Freeman did what she had to do in yesterday's 400m semi-final, winning comfortably, but it was what happened behind her that excited Australia's athletics hierarchy.
 In her first race against the world 400m champion, Sydney schoolgirl Jana Pittman showed she has a big future.
 While Freeman coasted to the line in 53.17sec, nearly five seconds outside her personal best, Pittman, 17, was only a couple of strides behind her, clocking 53.25sec.
 Patrick Dwyer was the fastest qualifier for the men's 400m final running 46.64sec in yet another impressive display from the talented AIS runner.

decb653f67511d340308944310354562,2000-02-26_The Weekend Australian_No Bush leeway as woman is executed,"DESPITE last-minute appeals, 62-year-old great-grandmother Betty Lou Beets is dead, lethally injected in a Texas prison.
 George W. Bush, Texas Governor and self-styled compassionate conservative who approved the execution, continues to fight for his political life in his presidential nomination campaign against John McCain.
 Beets is the 206th person to be executed in Texas since 1982.
 A prison spokesman said Beets was administered lethal drugs at 6.08pm local time and declared dead at 6.18pm. She declined to make a final statement.
Beets was sentenced in 1985 for killing her fifth husband, Dallas fireman Jimmy Don Beets, whose body was found buried in the front yard of their mobile home.
 She was charged, but not tried, for killing her fourth husband, Doyle Barker, who disappeared in 1981. Authorities found Barker's body under a tool shed outside her home during the investigation of Beets's death.
 Her appeal lawyers say she was a victim of emotional torment by Beets and suffered physical, sexual and psychological abuse in her four previous marriages and during her childhood.
 Sons of both men were at the execution, saying they had forgiven her, but that her execution was ""the right thing"".
 ""I can only pray and hope now she can hear me and I forgive her,"" said James Beets.
 Doyle Barker's son, Rodney, said: ""The state of Texas did the right thing tonight by putting Betty Lou to death. At least I know justice was done tonight.""
 Beets's execution comes at a time when Illinois has declared a moratorium on executions.
 Since the death penalty was introduced there, 12 people have been executed but 13 who have now been proven innocent have been released from death row. As Texas Governor, Mr Bush has speeded up the execution process and now 120 people have died during his term.
 Mr Bush insists he is convinced that in every execution he has approved, the person was guilty.
 In a country where 80 per cent of the people support the death penalty and not one leading politician opposes it -- not John McCain, Al Gore, Bill Bradley or Bill and Hillary Clinton -- Mr Bush may not suffer any political fallout.
 Mr Bush can hide behind the 18-member Pardons Board -- his appointees. Under Texas law he can only grant clemency on the majority recommendation of the board.
 The board unanimously rejected Beets's clemency plea and denied, 13-5, her plea for a 180-day stay so that evidence that she had been a battered wife could be considered.
 Mr Bush could have granted her a 30-day stay, but he approved the execution.
 It seems the defence of Beets, claimed by Amnesty International to be learning-disabled and hearing impaired, was seriously flawed -- a familiar pattern in Texas, according to opponents of the death penalty.
 Through the neglect of Beets's trial lawyer, E. Ray Andrews, she was denied the defence of battered-wife syndrome. She was also painted as a black widow, who cold-bloodedly killed two husbands for their life insurance.
 But it seems Mr Andrews, an alcoholic who later would serve a prison sentence for soliciting a pay-off as a district attorney, was responsible for the black-widow tag.
 He told a reporter he had met Beets in late 1984, several months before her arrest. A fire had damaged her trailer home and she wanted help dealing with her insurance.
 Beets told Mr Andrews her husband had disappeared more than a year before.
 ""This prompted me,"" Mr Andrews said, ""to inquire about possible insurance policies or pension plans of which she might have been the beneficiary.
 ""I distinctly recall that I was the one to suggest that she may have been entitled to benefits arising out of her husband's disappearance.""
 On ABC's Good Morning America last week, Beets, her voice cracking, said: ""I'm asking you to let me live. I'm asking for mercy.""
 Mr Bush was appearing on the same show as part of his presidential campaign. He said he had no unilateral right to spare an inmate's life.
 ""The thing I consider is whether or not a jury has heard all the facts and whether or not the person is guilty of the crime committed and whether or not the person has had full access to the court.""
 The system may have failed Beets on two out of these three issues. But it doesn't matter to her now. She's dead.
 Load-Date: March 1, 2002","DESPITE last-minute appeals, 62-year-old great-grandmother Betty Lou Beets is dead, lethally injected in a Texas prison. George W. Bush, Texas Governor and self-styled compassionate conservative who approved the execution, continues to fight for his political life in his presidential nomination campaign against John McCain. Beets is the 206th person to be executed in Texas since 1982. A prison spokesman said Beets was administered lethal drugs at 6.08pm local time and declared dead at 6.18pm. She declined to make a final statement. Beets was sentenced in 1985 for killing her fifth husband, Dallas fireman Jimmy Don Beets, whose body was found buried in the front yard of their mobile home. She was charged, but not tried, for killing her fourth husband, Doyle Barker, who disappeared in 1981. Authorities found Barker's body under a tool shed outside her home during the investigation of Beets's death. Her appeal lawyers say she was a victim of emotional torment by Beets and suffered physical, sexual and psychological abuse in her four previous marriages and during her childhood. Sons of both men were at the execution, saying they had forgiven her, but that her execution was ""the right thing"". ""I can only pray and hope now she can hear me and I forgive her,"" said James Beets. Doyle Barker's son, Rodney, said: ""The state of Texas did the right thing tonight by putting Betty Lou to death. At least I know justice was done tonight."" Beets's execution comes at a time when Illinois has declared a moratorium on executions. Since the death penalty was introduced there, 12 people have been executed but 13 who have now been proven innocent have been released from death row.

8311fff73f0ca6f8ea2a4b81017b1b30,2000-02-26_The Weekend Australian_Schizophrenic crime fears calmed,"A STUDY prompted by police shootings of people with schizophrenia has found that allowing sufferers to live in the community does not increase the risk of their committing offences.
 The study found that despite a move towards deinstitutionalising mental health patients, with an emphasis on drug-assisted community care, there has not been a proportionate increase in crime.
Only a small number of people with schizophrenia commit crimes, but they have a higher rate of conviction for criminal offences compared with the general population.
 The study found people not suffering from schizophrenia were just as likely to commit sexual offences, and there was a problem of perception regarding schizophrenics living in the community.
 Researchers from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health and the Mental Health Research Institute compared conviction statistics from 1985 in Victoria with those in 1975 before major deinstitutionalisation.
 Philip Burgess, co-leader of the study, said while people with schizophrenia were 3.5 times more likely to get a criminal conviction, this accounted for a fraction of a per cent of sufferers.
 ""What people forget is that people with schizophrenia are much more likely to take their own lives,"" Associate Professor Burgess said.
 He said the report, published in international medical journal The Lancet, made use of Vic-toria's computerised records on schizophrenic patients, which is the oldest in the world.
 Its release this week came as the Disability Council of NSW said, in its submission to a select committee inquiry into the state's increased prison population, that people with disabilities were disproportionately represented.
 Council chairman Leonie Manns said a 12th of the people in NSW prisons had intellectual disabilities although they were only 2 to 3 per cent of the population.
 ""They are much more vulnerable (emotionally) and often subject to abuse by other prisoners,"" she said.

e4c8a8839e471c9aea7b4d3461a025f4,"2000-02-27_Sunday Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)_A mother's love conquers all","Alison Lapper has no arms, under-developed legs and a big responsibility. She has just given birth, but wants no one's blessing or charity. FIONA WINGETT reports
ALISON Lapper will never be able to hold her baby. She will never swing him in the air and cuddle him the way other parents can, or chase him around the park and catch him when he falls.
 The talented painter and sculptor was born with no arms and tiny, shortened legs. Yet, at 34, she has become a single mother.
She knows she could not cope without a live-in nanny to place baby Parys Alan George on her breast for feeds, or to guide her when she bathes him or to help change his nappy.
 She is having to learn new skills -- not least to deal with the disapproval she knows her motherhood brings from some quarters.
 Alison acknowledges there is a stigma attached to Parys' birth, but becomes angry if she hears suggestions from passers-by that she can not look after him properly.
 ""What is the proper way to look after a child?"" she said. ""I cuddle him my way. Why do people jump to these conclusions? It makes me so angry.
 ""How do they know I can't look after my baby? They are just ignorant. The state isn't paying for him. I am paying for my own nanny.
 ""People should stop being so damned bigoted. They don't know me. They are making judgments about me -- I don't judge them.""
 But is there not a danger her child may all too soon become her carer?
 ""That's a hideous thought. I didn't have him so he could become my carer,"" she said.
 ""I've successfully lived on my own for 10 years. I don't need him to 'do' for me. I'm here to do for him.""
 Alison was born without arms as a result of phocomelia, a congenital condition similar to that caused by thalidomide.
 Alison's mother, Veronica, was told her daughter was deformed and would die and that she should forget she had had a baby.
 ""It was out of her control,"" Alison said. ""The system took me away from my mother because that's what they did then with children like me.""
 She was put into care, but her mother tracked her down when she was three.
 More than 30 years later, the baby taken from her is a woman with enormous blue eyes, fine cheekbones and spiky, close-cropped, bleached-blonde hair. She is also feisty and, in her own words, ""cocky"".
 She is an artist -- painting designs for Christmas cards -- who studied at university, has a ring through her nose, is a keen horse rider and an advanced driver.
 She is also a divorcee, from a marriage at 22 which, after only six months, ""didn't work out"".
 Her home, a seaside bungalow in West Sussex, England, is a patchwork of color. Her living room has shocking yellow walls, and there are images of bodies, either painted or sculpted, everywhere.
 Surrounded by handicapped children at a special school in East Sussex, where she lived from the age of six weeks to 17, Alison did not realise she was disabled until she was about 12.
 H ER childhood was undeniably tough. She never knew her father -- he left before she was born.
 At seven months, she was fitted with rudimentary prosthetic arms. By the age of two, the arms had hooks on the ends and were gas-powered. As she grew, the gas cylinders became bigger and bigger.
 ""They wanted us to look normal, yet made us look like Daleks (robots from the Doctor Who television series),"" she said. ""We were strange little creatures.""
 Alison, who has an elder sister, Vanessa, was able to see her family only three times a year.
 It was not until she went ""into the real world"" that she knew there was something different about her.
 But it did not stop her studying and becoming an artist, from going nightclubbing with her friends, then deciding at 23 she did not need the false limbs.
 Ten years later, when she had come to terms with the thought that she would never have children, she discovered she was pregnant.
 She refuses to name the father, saying only they had been seeing each other for a few months when she found she was expecting.
 ""He was around for quite a few months of the pregnancy, but he's not now,"" she said.
 ""I suppose it would be more ideal if he was still here, but I don't want anything to do with him.
 ""If Parys wants to get in touch with him when he gets older, I don't have a problem.""
 She is, quite simply, ""loved up"" with her ""little man"".
 But there is also the suspicion that she has so much to prove to her doubters that she would never admit to being overwhelmed by the prospect.
 She said she was terrified when she found out she was pregnant. ""I thought 'what am I going to do, should I have him?' And, 'how will I cope?' I was in a panic.""
 She decided against an abortion, knowing she had coped with her disability all her life.
 ""I'm so glad I didn't go through with it,"" she said. ""He was an accident, but a happy one.""
 The pregnancy was ""a breeze"" and Alison carried her baby as long as she could -- to 35 weeks -- before she had a caesarean.
 ""I had to have him then because I just couldn't get around,"" she said.
 ""It tested my body to the limit and it affected my mobility so much in the last weeks -- getting off the sofa, showering myself, using the lavatory -- the doctors decided to deliver him then.""
 The birth had its complications. A drip had to be inserted into a vein in her neck.
 ""It was incredibly scary. I'm not sure I'd want to do it again tomorrow,"" she said.
 ""But when they put Parys on my chest in the recovery room, it blew my mind. He was put on my breast and I could touch him with my shoulder. It was an amazing feeling.
 ""They always talk about the love you have for your child being unlike any other -- and I finally understood.
 ""It is a whole little life I am responsible for. Rather than being daunted by it, I know I can do a good job or screw it up -- we all can -- but I want to do the best job.""
 Alison knew before Parys was born that he had not inherited her condition, but it would not have worried her if he had.
 ""But I'm glad he hasn't, more for him than for me, because it will make his life easier,"" she said.
 ""Naturally, I really want the best for him, although I think it's a shame we think that everyone has to be so damned perfect.""
 S HE does not know what the future holds. ""I'm a person who lives for the day and sees what happens.""
 Alison already has had to deal with the reactions of people she meets in the street, who assume the baby belongs to her nanny.
 ""When you tell them he's actually mine and see their reaction, it hurts,"" she said.
 ""I am self-employed, so I can give Parys time. That's the most important thing.
 ""I've never wished that I could have had arms to hold him, because that would make me sad.
 ""I hope I can make up for it in other ways. After all, arms aren't the be-all and end-all.""

 Based in the old council work sheds at Ringwood, the Equipment Recycling Network Inc. is affectionately known as ""Erni"".
 Its team of 23 volunteers is co-ordinated by Susan McKoy, recently awarded the Deakin 2000 Australia Day Award for her service to the community.
The group provides computers and computer accessories for a small charge to cover costs to people with disabilities, especially children, who have been referred by doctors or other health service providers.
 Erni is always looking for more donations and sturdy and reliable 486s are welcomed, as well as Pentiums and laptops.
 The volunteers, who can expect to be rewarded in coffee, chocolate cake and ""lots of hugs and thank yous"", clean the hard drives of the donated computers and then reload them with public domain software.
 For families struggling to survive on a pension or pay high medical expenses, a low-cost computer could make a big difference, Mrs McKoy said.
 An old 486 can help someone stay in touch by e-mail, continue studying or simply write letters. Laptops are particularly useful for people confined to bed or in wheelchairs.
 Charges are kept low and occasionally people are in such financial straits a computer will be provided free. Often these people will demand to pay something towards the cost of their new pre-loved PC.
 ""We had a client who insisted on paying for her computer at the rate of $2 a week,"" Mrs McKoy said.
 The gratitude of Erni's clients is sticky-taped around the former shower recess and bathroom walls. There are ""thank you"" drawings from children, photos and letters from families and small gifts, such as a tiny ribbon-wrapped wish marble.
 Donations come from individuals, businesses, universities, schools and hospitals.
 Ewen Bell, whose company TwoCats hosts the group's website, has asked his corporate clients to donate equipment.
 Obtaining equipment, spare parts, transportation and technical support is an exercise in perpetual motion for Erni's volunteers.
 On a wet and rainy day in Mt Waverley last December, a passer-by noticed that Micros Fidelio Australia was moving offices and had dumped unwanted 3.11 and W95 software licences into a garbage skip.
 The passer-by contacted Erni and Mrs McKoy leaped into her car to recover the treasure trove.
 Later, damp but happy, she not only had the back seat full of software licences, but had more donations from the company.
 Probably the group's most loyal supporter is Maroondah Council which provides funds, legal and business support.
 The rest of the money that Erni needs to keep going is raised by selling chocolates and firewood, charity auctions and shopping tours.

6852d8f9afbe3c4096d782eb715b35f0,2000-02-29_The Australian_Is your garage door sun blast-compliant_ - DEFRAG,"OKAY, we can all start panicking again. Feel free to put your underpants on your head, smear your body with Nutella and run around screaming: ""We're doomed, we're doomed.""
 We don't know about you, but the complete lack of a millennium bug to generate anything close to global chaos had us at a loose end.
 We'd watched all those Charlton Heston movies from the 1970s, such as Soylent Green and The Omega Man, about a post-apocalyptic world in which we were all reduced to savagery and quite frankly we'd psyched ourselves up for Armageddon.
We were looking forward to adopting pained expressions and saying things like, ""Damn you! Damn you all to hell"" as well as ""Soylent Green is people!"" which wouldn't strictly be relevant, but that's something we tend to yell a lot anyway.
 We were already plotting how to steal a monster truck and what shops to loot once anarchy emerged.
 But no, the bug didn't even cause our video to accidentally tape that Full House episode where Bob Saget learns some important lessons about being a father. Which is pretty much every episode, as far as we can tell.
 Luckily scientists have been working around the clock to come up with a new threat to humanity as we know it -- and it's our old enemy, the sun.
 Yes, for thousands of years the sun has been lulling us into a false sense of security by keeping us toasty warm and allowing plants to indulge in photosynthesis on a regular basis, when in reality it has been biding its time, waiting until humanity had developed to the point where we were totally reliant on technology, so it could wreak its deadly vengeance.
 A story in the Los Angeles Times last week alerted us to the fact we are approaching a point in the sun's 11-year cycle called the solar maximum, ""an interval of months marked by wrenching solar activity that hurls billion-ton blasts of X-rays and radioactive particles towards Earth"".
 Which sounds pretty cool to us. We've read our comic books and we know that X-rays and radioactive particles are just the thing for acquiring superhero powers.
 But the LA Times was not so positive: ""Such blasts can disable satellites, knock out navigational systems and darken entire cities by frying electrical grids.""
 Offering evidence of the sort of disaster that the solar maximum can create, the paper pointed to a 1989 storm that made garage doors in San Francisco open and close, and you can just imagine the sort of havoc that caused.
 Technology being much more prevalent now that it was way back in 1989, much more than our garage doors are at risk. The remote control for the television could be affected as well, and that can only lead to rioting.
 So if you were one of those people who stockpiled tins of Spam for Y2K you can probably start feeling pretty smug right about now. You may get to suffer chronic indigestion after all.
Listen to me, bonehead
ARE you sick of listening to things the old-fashioned way?
 Well if so, Defrag has some news that may cause you to shout ""Yahoo and hurrah!"" so if you are reading this in a public place, don't say we didn't warn you.
It seems that Japanese company Temco has developed a pair of headphones for mobile phones that bypasses the ears and uses something called bone conduction technology to transmit sounds through your skull and directly into your auditory system. I'm sure you'll agree with us when we say: ""Euwww. That's kind of creepy.""
 And we wonder if the same sort of filters that our ears provide are available with this system.
 Imagine, for instance, that your boss rings you with a plan about how to implement technology within the company, despite the fact he or she doesn't have the technological aptitude to use the warm-air hand dryer in the toilets.
 If you were using your ears to take this call, you would automatically tune out and just insert a few appropriate phrases of agreement every now and again.
 Have these so-called scientists done any research to determine whether the paying-no-attention technology is at the ear or brain level?
 What if bone conduction bypasses all of that and you spend weeks going nuts trying to figure out how to make the stupid idea work?
 It would certainly waste a lot of time that could be spent pointlessly surfing the Web.
 Until we know for sure, Defrag recommends wearing a tinfoil hat while using the headset, because it's better to look foolish than to be foolish.
 Load-Date: March 1, 2002","OKAY, we can all start panicking again. Feel free to put your underpants on your head, smear your body with Nutella and run around screaming: ""We're doomed, we're doomed."" We don't know about you, but the complete lack of a millennium bug to generate anything close to global chaos had us at a loose end. We'd watched all those Charlton Heston movies from the 1970s, such as Soylent Green and The Omega Man, about a post-apocalyptic world in which we were all reduced to savagery and quite frankly we'd psyched ourselves up for Armageddon. We were looking forward to adopting pained expressions and saying things like, ""Damn you! Damn you all to hell"" as well as ""Soylent Green is people!"" which wouldn't strictly be relevant, but that's something we tend to yell a lot anyway. We were already plotting how to steal a monster truck and what shops to loot once anarchy emerged. But no, the bug didn't even cause our video to accidentally tape that Full House episode where Bob Saget learns some important lessons about being a father. Which is pretty much every episode, as far as we can tell. Luckily scientists have been working around the clock to come up with a new threat to humanity as we know it -- and it's our old enemy, the sun. Yes, for thousands of years the sun has been lulling us into a false sense of security by keeping us toasty warm and allowing plants to indulge in photosynthesis on a regular basis, when in reality it has been biding its time, waiting until humanity had developed to the point where we were totally reliant on technology, so it could wreak its deadly vengeance. A story in the Los Angeles Times last week alerted us to the fact we are approaching a point in the sun's 11-year cycle called the solar maximum, ""an interval of months marked by wrenching solar activity that hurls billion-ton blasts of X-rays and radioactive particles towards Earth"". Which sounds pretty cool to us. We've read our comic books and we know that X-rays and radioactive particles are just the thing for acquiring superhero powers. But the LA Times was not so positive: ""Such blasts can disable satellites, knock out navigational systems and darken entire cities by frying electrical grids."" Offering evidence of the sort of disaster that the solar maximum can create, the paper pointed to a 1989 storm that made garage doors in San Francisco open and close, and you can just imagine the sort of havoc that caused.

Microsoft Windows 98 SE
THIS is a story of a multi-computer home. It's the one more and more people are moving to -- a network with mum, dad and the kids all needing computer access, and Internet access.
 For many households, the roadblock to the so-called superhighway is their telephone line. So what do you do if everyone wants to use the phone line at once? Share.
Windows 98 SE includes Internet Connection, which enables you to connect your modem to one machine, and access it from your other (networked) PCs.
 Microsoft shipped it to me in a flash and I installed it, tested it with Win 98 on the server (machine with modem) and Win 95 on the client (machine without modem).
 The server installation was straightforward enough, as it was part of the Win 98 install, and creating an installation disk for my client machines was reasonably easy too.
 But after that things became more difficult. The only instructions assumed that the PCs were not already networked. I eventually gave up trying to work out what steps were required for an existing network and rang Microsoft technical support. Thirty minutes later, I could browse the Internet and download files from either machine. Neat.
 Except that I run a rather large Web site and I was in the middle of a big rebuild, and about to do a comparison of FTP software (used to transfer files to and from Web sites).
 Then I discovered that I could no longer rely on any of the FTP programs I had in my test suite to copy files.
 After a 45 minute wait on the support line, and needing 12 separate connections to copy about 50 files, the love affair was over.
 Two more support calls and I didn't even get through the queue.
 Three months later, after initially refusing to believe that I really had a problem, a Microsoft representative finally found a reference in their database which, he told me, reported that Microsoft Windows 98 SE's Internet Connection had problems with graphical user interface (GUI) FTP programs. He recommended that I use a DOS program instead.
 When I asked if I could quote him on this, the person became, er, uncomfortable.
 Reinstating winsock immediately got all the FTP programs working again, but they couldn't tell me the solution.
 Alternatively, I installed iShare from Artisoft (the people who brought us LANtastic). So did a fellow reviewer. On his machine it started up like a charm, ran like a dream, and is a joy to have on disk.
 The technical support person at Uplink in Australia and I spent three hours reversing all the remnants of the Internet Connection changes to my configuration.
 A 10 minute install and there it was, modem sharing across PCs, with my GUI FTP programs racing along nicely.
 The latest rebuild of iShare 3.5 supports Windows 2000, for all those of you about to take the plunge. It is robust and fast to install on a healthy system. By default it caches at the server, so if you are using the server and other (client) users are thrashing your disk, you may want to disable that.
 The only trap for new players is that iShare can disconnect the Internet when the client logs out, while the server is still using the connection. To ensure that iShare knows the server is using the connection, you should connect to the Web using iShare at the server as well as from the clients.
 All things considered, changing which icon I use to connect to the Web is a small price to pay to be able to share Internet access with others on my network, or to simply run downloads on other machines while I do my work on the server machine.
 So, it is possible to share a modem connection, it does impact on your response times because there is more data travelling on the line, but it can solve household disputes over whose turn it is to connect up.
