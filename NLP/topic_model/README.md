# Topic Modelling
The idea in this section is to use PySpark to perform large-scale topic modelling on the news text using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method. LDA is a probabilistic (Bayesian) method that looks at word occurrences both within a document and across documents in a corpus, so it is expected to perform better with richer text content, i.e. using the entire article body rather than just the extracted quotes. Because it uses a bag-of-words approach, it should also scale to a large fraction of the full data as it grows with time. Two options for running LDA topic model on the GGT data are described below.
